# Authentication Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement user authentication using Clerk in the existing Next.js application. This will include user registration, login, and session management, focusing on the frontend components.

## Goals
- Securely integrate Clerk for authentication.
- Create a user-friendly interface for sign-up, login, and profile management.
- Manage user state using React context.
- Ensure the implementation follows best practices for security and usability.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Research and Setup
- Confirm Clerk's integration with Next.js using the official documentation.
- Install the Clerk React SDK: `pnpm add @clerk/clerk-react`
- Configure Clerk in the Next.js app by adding the Clerk provider in _app.js.

### 2. Create Authentication Context
- Define a context to manage user state (e.g., user object, loading status, errors).
- Implement functions for sign-in, sign-out, and checking authentication status.
- Use Clerk's hooks or custom logic to handle authentication.

### 3. Implement Authentication Pages
- Create a sign-up page component using Clerk's elements or a custom form.
- Create a login page component.
- Implement a logout button component.
- Develop a profile page to display user information.

### 4. Protect Routes
- Create a higher-order component or middleware to protect routes that require authentication.
- Use Next.js's built-in routing features to handle protected pages.

### 5. Error Handling and Feedback
- Implement error handling for authentication failures.
- Provide user feedback messages for success and errors.

### 6. Testing
- Write unit tests for the authentication context and components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Write integration tests for the authentication flow.

### 7. Security Review
- Ensure compliance with OWASP guidelines (e.g., prevent XSS, CSRF).
- Use secure methods for token storage and session management.

## Dependencies
- Clerk account and API keys.
- Next.js app structure.

## Checklist
- [ ] Install Clerk SDK.
- [ ] Configure Clerk in _app.js.
- [ ] Create authentication context.
- [ ] Implement sign-up page.
- [ ] Implement login page.
- [ ] Implement logout functionality.
- [ ] Protect routes.
- [ ] Write unit tests.
- [ ] Write integration tests.
- [ ] Conduct security review.

## Notes
- Start with a minimal implementation to test core functionality.
- Iterate based on test results and security audits.
