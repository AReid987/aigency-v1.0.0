# TUI Application Fix

This document explains the fix for the Text User Interface (TUI) application's component mounting issue.

## Problem Description

The TUI application was experiencing errors related to UI component mounting. Specifically, the `DataTable` component was being set up in the `on_mount` method instead of in the `compose` method, which caused issues with the UI component mounting order in the Textual framework.

## Root Cause

In the Textual framework, UI components should be properly defined in the `compose` method rather than trying to mount widgets in the `on_mount` method. The issue was related to the timing of when UI components are available in the application lifecycle.

## Fix Details

The fix involves:

1. Moving the DataTable column setup from `on_mount` to the `compose` method
2. Simplifying the `on_mount` method to only handle post-mounting tasks
3. Making the `refresh_content_list` method more robust with error handling

### Changes Made

1. In the `compose` method:
   - Added code to set up the DataTable columns right after creating the DataTable

2. In the `on_mount` method:
   - Removed the DataTable column setup code
   - Kept only the necessary initialization code

3. In the `refresh_content_list` method:
   - Added error handling to prevent crashes
   - Made it more robust to handle cases when the table might not be fully initialized

## How to Apply the Fix

You can apply the fix using the provided scripts:

1. Run the fix script:
   ```bash
   cd apps/extract
   python fix_tui.py
   ```

2. Test the fix:
   ```bash
   python test_fix.py
   ```

## Verification

The fix can be verified by running the TUI application and checking that:

1. The application starts without errors
2. The DataTable is properly displayed with columns
3. Content can be loaded and displayed in the table

## Technical Details

### Textual Framework Component Lifecycle

In the Textual framework, the component lifecycle follows this order:

1. `compose` method: Define the UI structure and create widgets
2. Widget mounting: Widgets are mounted to the DOM
3. `on_mount` method: Called after all widgets are mounted
4. Event handling: The application starts handling events

The fix ensures that the DataTable columns are set up during the `compose` phase, which is the correct time to define the structure of UI components.

### Error Handling

The updated `refresh_content_list` method includes error handling to prevent crashes if the method is called before the table is fully initialized or if there are issues with the database.

## Backup

The fix script automatically creates a backup of the original file before making changes. The backup is stored in the same directory with a timestamp suffix.
