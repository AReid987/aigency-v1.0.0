# TUI Application Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

We successfully fixed the issue with the Text User Interface (TUI) application's component mounting. The application was experiencing errors because the `DataTable` component was being set up in the `on_mount` method instead of in the `compose` method, which caused issues with the UI component mounting order in the Textual framework.

## Solution Implemented

The fix involved:

1. Moving the DataTable column setup from `on_mount` to the `compose` method
2. Simplifying the `on_mount` method to only handle post-mounting tasks
3. Making the `refresh_content_list` method more robust with error handling

## Files Created

1. **fix_tui.py**: Script that applies the fix to the TUI application
2. **test_fix.py**: Script that verifies the fix was applied correctly
3. **fix_and_test.sh**: Shell script that runs both the fix and verification scripts
4. **TUI_FIX_README.md**: Documentation explaining the fix in detail

## How to Apply the Fix

To apply the fix, run:

```bash
cd apps/extract
./fix_and_test.sh
```

This will:
1. Apply the fix to the TUI application
2. Create a backup of the original file
3. Verify that the fix was applied correctly

## Verification

The fix is verified by checking that:
1. The DataTable columns are set up in the `compose` method
2. The `on_mount` method no longer contains the DataTable column setup code
3. The `refresh_content_list` method includes error handling

## Backup

The fix script automatically creates a backup of the original file before making changes. The backup is stored in the same directory with a timestamp suffix.

## Next Steps

1. Run the TUI application to ensure it works correctly in a real environment
2. Consider adding unit tests to prevent similar issues in the future
3. Update the documentation to reflect the correct way to set up UI components in the Textual framework
