**Explanation and Adaptation:**

This Python code provides a template for a Skyvern script that incorporates anti-bot bypass techniques.  Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Rotating User Agents:** The `get_random_user_agent()` function uses the `fake_useragent` library to generate a random user agent for each request.  This helps to avoid being identified as a bot based on a static user agent.

2.  **Random Delays:** The `random_delay()` function adds a random delay between actions.  This simulates human behavior and makes it harder for websites to detect automated activity.

3.  **Randomized Mouse Movements:** The `randomize_mouse_movement()` function is a placeholder.  Skyvern would need to implement actual mouse movement to simulate human interaction with the page.  This could involve moving the mouse to different elements on the page before clicking or filling out forms.

4.  **Proxies (if possible):** The `safe_request()` function includes a comment indicating where proxy support could be added.  To implement proxy support, you would need to:
    *   Obtain a list of proxies.
    *   Randomly select a proxy for each request.
    *   Add the proxy to the `requests.get()` call using the `proxies` parameter.

5.  **Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms:** The `safe_request()` function includes error handling and retry mechanisms.  If a request fails, it will be retried up to a maximum number of times.  This helps to ensure that the script can continue running even if there are temporary network issues or other problems.

**Adapting the Script for Specific Websites:**

To adapt this script for specific websites, you will need to:

1.  **Replace the Example URL:** Replace `https://example.com/survey` with the actual URL of the survey you want to automate.

2.  **Implement Skyvern Logic:** Replace the comments in the `skyvern_survey_automation()` function with Skyvern logic to parse the page and interact with survey elements.  This will involve:
    *   Using Skyvern's selectors to find the survey questions and answer options.
    *   Using Skyvern's actions to fill out forms and click buttons.

3.  **Adjust Selectors and Actions:** You may need to adjust the selectors and actions to match the specific HTML structure of the survey website.

4.  **Handle CAPTCHAs:** If the survey website uses CAPTCHAs, you will need to implement a CAPTCHA solving mechanism.  This could involve using a third-party CAPTCHA solving service or implementing a manual CAPTCHA solving process.

5.  **Test and Refine:** Test the script thoroughly and refine it as needed to ensure that it is working correctly and reliably.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Anti-bot measures are constantly evolving, so you may need to update the script periodically to maintain its effectiveness.
*   Be aware of the terms of service of the survey websites you are automating.  Some websites may prohibit automated activity.
*   Use this script responsibly and ethically.
