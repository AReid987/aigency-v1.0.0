# Product Requirements Document: Autonomous Survey Testing Framework

# **Product Requirements Document: Autonomous Survey Testing Framework**

## **1. Goal, Objective, and Context**

- **Context:** Traditional software testing methods often fail to replicate the continuous, 24/7 usage patterns of a live production application. This gap can lead to undiscovered stability, reliability, or accuracy issues that only manifest under constant, long-term operation.

- **Objective:** To create a fully autonomous testing framework that perfectly mimics human user behavior to complete surveys, providing the most authentic, persistent, and continuous testing possible.

- **Goal:** The primary goal of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to deliver a stable, autonomous framework that proves the viability of this testing method. It must run for extended periods without intervention, support a baseline number of applications, and operate within a zero-cost, open-source technology stack.

## **2. Functional Requirements (MVP)**

1. **User Profile & Data Management:** The system must provide a secure and intuitive interface for users (QA/Devs) to input, manage, and store the test profile data that the agent will use.

2. **Automated Test Scheduling:** The system must allow for the automatic scheduling of continuous test runs with configurable intervals and randomized start times (jitter).

3. **Realistic Human Behavior Simulation:** The agent must simulate human-like interaction patterns, including variable typing speeds, randomized delays between actions, and periodic rest intervals.

4. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Intervention:** The system must include a mechanism for a human operator to pause the automation, take manual control of the browser session for debugging or other actions, and then resume the automated process.

5. **Live Activity Dashboard:** The system must provide a web-based dashboard to display the agent's real-time status, essential logs, and a view of the live browser session it is controlling.

## **3. Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)**

- **Reliability:** The system must be able to run continuously for a minimum of 72 hours without failure or requiring a manual restart.

- **Security:** All user profile data, credentials, and sensitive information used by the agent must be stored securely using strong, proven encryption methods.

- **Cost:** The entire system for the MVP/POC must be deployable and operable with a zero-cost footprint, exclusively using free and open-source technologies.

- **Usability:** The interfaces for managing test data and viewing the live dashboard must be intuitive and easy to understand for technical users (QA/Devs) with minimal training.

- **Extensibility:** The architecture must be designed in a modular way that allows for new survey applications to be added in the future with minimal changes to the core framework.

## **4. User Interaction and Design Goals**

- **Overall Vision & Experience:** The UI should project a professional, data-intensive look and feel suitable for a technical tool, while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic that avoids clutter.

- **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The dashboard's core will be a simple layout featuring a real-time log stream and a browser view. Data management will be handled via a straightforward web form and support for file uploads (e.g., YAML, JSON).

- **Target Devices:** The application will be a desktop-first web application.

## **5. Technical Assumptions**

- **Overarching Constraint:** All technologies must be open-source and have a zero-cost footprint for a single-user POC.

- **Core Framework & Platform:** The backend agent will be built in Python using the Skyvern framework, APScheduler, and `asyncio`/`ThreadPoolExecutor`.

- **Data Storage:** Data will be managed in a locally encrypted configuration file.

- **Deployment:** The application will be containerized using Docker with `supervisord`.

- **Repository & Service Architecture:** The project will be structured as a **Monorepo** managed by **Turborepo**.

- **Testing Requirements:** For the MVP, functional verification will be performed manually. An automated CI/CD pipeline is required to handle builds and unit testing.

## **6. Epic Overview**

- **Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Deployment Pipeline**

    - **Goal:** To establish the core project structure (Turborepo Monorepo), development environment (Docker), and an automated CI/CD pipeline.

    - **Story 1.1:** As a Developer, I want a new Turborepo monorepo initialized.

    - **Story 1.2:** As a Developer, I want a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for the Python backend agent.

    - **Story 1.3:** As a Developer, I want a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for the frontend dashboard.

    - **Story 1.4:** As a System Administrator, I want a basic CI/CD pipeline configured.

- **Epic 2: Core Automation Agent & Engine**

    - **Goal:** To build the backend agent responsible for scheduling, human-like execution, and HITL intervention.

    - **Story 2.1:** As a System, I want to use a scheduler to trigger a survey-taking job.

    - **Story 2.2:** As the Agent, I want to securely load a user profile from an encrypted local file.

    - **Story 2.3:** As the Agent, I want to launch a browser instance using Skyvern and navigate to a URL.

    - **Story 2.4:** As the Agent, I want to incorporate human-like behavior into my actions.

    - **Story 2.5:** As a Developer, I want a simple mechanism to pause and resume the agent's automation.

- **Epic 3: Management UI & Live Dashboard**

    - **Goal:** To create the web-based UI for managing test data and viewing agent activities.

    - **Story 3.1:** As a Developer, I want a basic frontend application shell set up.

    - **Story 3.2:** As a QA Engineer, I want a simple web form to input and save user profile data.

    - **Story 3.3:** As a QA Engineer, I want to upload a configuration file to populate user profile data.

    - **Story 3.4:** As a QA Engineer, I want a dashboard that displays the agent's live browser view and a log stream.
