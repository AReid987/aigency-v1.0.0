# Project Brief: Autonomous Survey Testing Framework

# **Project Brief: Autonomous Survey Testing Framework**

## **1. Introduction / Problem Statement**

Traditional testing methods do not adequately replicate the continuous, 24/7 usage patterns of live production applications. This project aims to solve that by creating a persistent, automated testing framework that continuously validates an application's stability, accuracy, and reliability under constant operation, mirroring a real-world environment.

## **2. Vision & Goals**

- **Vision:** To create a fully autonomous testing framework that perfectly mimics human user behavior to complete surveys, providing the most authentic continuous testing possible.

- **Primary Goals (MVP):**

    1. Ensure the framework can operate continuously for a minimum of 72 hours without requiring any manual intervention or restarts.

    2. Successfully automate the end-to-end survey workflow for an initial set of 3 distinct survey applications to prove the framework's adaptability.

    3. Implement core human-like interaction patterns (e.g., randomized delays, typing simulation) and secure data handling for all automated actions to ensure the testing is both realistic and trustworthy.

## **3. Target Audience / Users**

The primary users of this framework are Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers, who will use it for continuous regression and stability testing, and Developers, who will use it to test new features against a realistic, high-load environment before deployment.

## **4. Key Features / Scope (MVP)**

1. **User Profile & Data Management:** A secure component for storing test profiles. It must provide an intuitive interface for QA/Devs to easily input and manage the personal data and survey answers the agent will use.

2. **Automated & Continuous Test Scheduler:** A configurable scheduler to trigger test runs automatically (e.g., every 4 hours), supporting indefinite operation and randomized start times.

3. **Realistic Human Behavior Simulation:** The agent must mimic human interaction patterns, including randomized delays, variable typing speed, and periodic rest intervals to create a realistic load.

4. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Override:** A mechanism allowing an operator to seamlessly pause the automation, take manual control of the browser session to interject or debug, and then resume the automated process.

5. **Live Activity Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard that provides a real-time view of the agent's actions, including a direct view of the browser it's operating in, current status, and essential logs.

## **5. Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas**

- **Full-Scale Application Support:** Expand the framework to support 12+ different survey applications.

- **Advanced Anti-Detection Suite:** Implement sophisticated anti-detection measures, including browser fingerprint rotation and residential proxy integration.

- **Profile Persona Rotation:** Develop the capability to use multiple user personas or profiles to avoid pattern detection.

## **6. Known Technical Constraints or Preferences**

- **Budget Constraint:** The Proof of Concept (POC) version must be free to develop, use, and operate for a single user. All chosen technologies must be open-source and have no associated costs for this use case.

- **Core Framework:** Skyvern

- **Scheduler:** APScheduler

- **Concurrency:** Python's `asyncio` or `ThreadPoolExecutor`

- **Data Storage:** A secure vault. Given the "no budget" constraint, a locally encrypted configuration file is the primary option.

- **Deployment:** Docker, with `supervisord` for error recovery.
