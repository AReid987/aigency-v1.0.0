# Backlog

### **Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Deployment Pipeline**

- **1.1:** As a Developer, I want a new Turborepo monorepo initialized so that I have a structured foundation for housing both the backend agent and frontend UI code.

- **1.2:** As a Developer, I want a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for the Python backend agent so that I can build and run it in a consistent, containerized environment.

- **1.3:** As a Developer, I want a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for the frontend dashboard so that I can build and run the UI in a consistent, containerized environment.

- **1.4:** As a System Administrator, I want a basic CI/CD pipeline configured so that any code pushed to the `main` branch is automatically built and tested.

### **Epic 2: Core Automation Agent & Engine**

- **2.1:** As a System, I want to use a scheduler to trigger a survey-taking job at a configurable interval so that the testing process can run automatically and continuously.

- **2.2:** As the Agent, I want to securely load a user profile from an encrypted local file so that I have the necessary data to perform my tasks.

- **2.3:** As the Agent, I want to launch a browser instance using Skyvern and navigate to a specified URL so that I can begin a survey workflow.

- **2.4:** As the Agent, I want to incorporate human-like behavior into my actions, including delays and rests, so that my interactions are more realistic.

- **2.5:** As a Developer, I want a simple mechanism to pause and resume the agent's automation so that I can debug or handle unexpected scenarios.

### **Epic 3: Management UI & Live Dashboard**

- **3.1:** As a Developer, I want a basic frontend application shell set up so that I have a place to build the dashboard and data management components.

- **3.2:** As a QA Engineer, I want a simple web form to input and save user profile data so that I can easily configure the agent's test persona.

- **3.3:** As a QA Engineer, I want to upload a configuration file to populate the user profile data so that I can quickly set up complex test profiles.

- **3.4:** As a QA Engineer, I want a dashboard that displays the agent's live browser view and a real-time log stream so that I can monitor its activity.
