# Implementation

## **Phase 1:
### The Advanced CLI with a Textual User Interface (TUI)**

- This initial phase focuses on creating a powerful, interactive command-line tool.
- This makes the workflow immediately usable and testable.

### **Core Logic & CLI:**

### **Typer:**
- This is a perfect choice for the CLI foundation.
- It makes creating a command-line interface with commands, arguments, and options incredibly simple and clean.
- We can structure our three-prompt workflow as distinct commands
	(e.g., `create-avatar`, `write-diary`, `build-page`).

#### **Gemini CLI / API:**
- Instead of scripting the `llm` tool, we can directly use the Google AI Python SDK (which powers the Gemini CLI) within our Typer application.
- This gives more programmatic control.
- The Gemini model, with its large context window, is ideal for handling the detailed prompts and passing context between steps.

### **Interactive TUI:**

#### **Textual:**
- This will elevate your CLI from a simple command-executor to a rich, interactive application within the terminal. You can use it to:

	- Create forms for users to input the `[OFFER]` details.
	- Display the generated avatar and diary entries in formatted, scrollable windows.
	- Provide a real-time log of the agent's "thoughts" as it processes each step.
	- Allow the user to review and even edit the outputs at each stage before proceeding.


### **Conceptual Structure (using Python, Typer, and Textual):**
```python
# main.py
import typer
from textual.app import App
from rich.text import Text
# ... other imports for Gemini API

class LandingPageGenerator(App):
    """A TUI for generating landing pages."""

    def on_mount(self) -> None:
        # Build the initial form to get offer details
        # ...

    def process_step_1(self, offer_details):
        # Call Gemini API with Prompt 1
        # Display the avatar in a Textual widget
        # ...

# ... more Textual app logic

cli_app = typer.Typer()

@cli_app.command()
def generate():
    """Starts the interactive landing page generator."""
    app = LandingPageGenerator()
    app.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cli_app()
```
## **Phase 2: Implementing the Agent Architecture**

- Here, we'll evolve the core logic into a more formal agentic system.
- This makes the process more modular, intelligent, and ready for complex interactions.

### **Agent Frameworks:**

#### **LangGraph:**
- This is an excellent choice for orchestrating multi-step workflows.
- We can model our 3-prompt process as a graph where each node represents a step (Research, Dimensionalization, Build).
- The state of the graph would carry
	- the `[OFFER]` details
	- the generated `avatar`
	- the `diary_entries`
	- the `landing_page_code`.
- This makes the flow explicit, debuggable, and extensible.

#### **AutoGen:**
- Also a very strong contender, particularly for its strength in creating conversational agents that can collaborate.
- You could define a "ResearchAgent," a "CreativeWriterAgent," and a "WebDeveloperAgent."
- A "ManagerAgent" would orchestrate the conversation between them, passing the artifacts from one to the other, mirroring a real-world creative team.

#### **Conversational AI:**
- This is where the system becomes truly interactive.
	- The agent (built with LangGraph or AutoGen) will start by asking the user questions to "distill the target audience."
	- Instead of a static form, it can have a back-and-forth conversation to clarify the
		- `[OFFER]`
		- `[AUDIENCE]`
		- `[PROBLEM]`.

    - For example:

        - **Agent:** "Tell me about the product you want to build a landing page for."

        - **User:** "It's a prompt management platform."

        - **Agent:** "Interesting. Who are the primary users? Developers, writers, or someone else?"

	- This conversation dynamically builds the context needed for the first prompt.

#### **Connecting to the CLI:**
- The agent framework will now be the core engine.
- Your Typer/Textual CLI will become the "frontend" for this engine.
- When a user runs the `generate` command, it will kick off the agentic workflow.
- The agent can then stream its progress and results back to the Textual interface.

## **Phase 3: Production Scale with a Next.js Frontend**

This is the final evolution, turning your powerful backend tool into a collaborative, user-friendly web application.

### **Backend API:**

- Your agent system (built with LangGraph/AutoGen and running in Python) will be exposed as a web API, likely using a framework like **FastAPI** or **Flask**.
- This API will have endpoints to:
	- Start a new landing page generation session.
	- Send user messages to the conversational agent.
	- Stream back agent responses and artifacts (avatars, diary entries, code).

### **Next.js Frontend:**
- The Next.js application will provide the user interface. It will communicate with your Python backend API.
- This allows for:
#### **User Accounts and Collaboration:**
- Multiple users can log in, work on different landing page projects, and share results.
#### **Rich Interaction:**
- Instead of a terminal, users interact with a modern web interface, including rich text editors for the generated copy and a live preview for the landing page.
#### **Multi-Agent Visualization:**
- You could even create a UI that visualizes the different agents (e.g., the researcher, the writer, the coder) working together, passing tasks and information between each other.
#### **Other Tools:**
- **OpenHands & RovoDev:**
	- These tools are more focused on being AI agents that operate within a developer's environment to perform tasks like coding and debugging.
	- In your architecture, you could see your "WebDeveloperAgent" _using_ a tool like RovoDev under the hood to write or refactor the final HTML/CSS code, making it a "tool" in the agent's tool belt.

- **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit):**
	- As a Google-supported framework, ADK is another excellent option for the agent architecture layer, especially if you plan to deploy on Google Cloud.
	- It's designed for building and deploying modular, multi-agent systems.

This iterative plan is a fantastic way to build a complex, valuable application.
- Start by proving the core value in a focused CLI
- then layer in intelligence with an agent framework
- finally, scale it to a full-fledged web product.
