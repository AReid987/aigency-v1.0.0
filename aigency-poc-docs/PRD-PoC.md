# Aigency Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal, Objective and Context

The primary goal of the Aigency POC is to validate the core hypothesis that an AI-powered squad can act as a powerful force-multiplier for individual creators and small teams. The objective is to build a functional prototype that demonstrates the platform's ability to take an idea from conception to a high-quality, deployable output (like a Single-Page Application) through a collaborative, conversational interface, proving its value to our target users and setting the stage for future development.

## Functional Requirements (MVP)

**Collaborative Ideation (The "Collaboratory"):**
The system must provide a space for users to brainstorm, develop, and track ideas. This space needs to support both real-time and asynchronous collaboration.

**AI-Powered Development (The "Aigency Squad"):**
Users must be able to interact with the squad of AI agents through a conversational interface. This core function is responsible for taking user requests and generating high-quality outputs like content, SPAs, etc.

**Project Management:**
To manage the work generated by the squad, users must have access to a simple, intuitive Kanban board to visualize the flow of work from Epics to Stories and Tasks.

**Prototyping & Visualization:**
The platform must provide a feature to display data visualizations, reports, and other generated or uploaded prototypes.

## Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)

**Performance:**
The user interface must be fast and responsive. Agent interactions and the generation of outputs should feel fluid, avoiding long, unexplained waits. The final generated products (like SPAs) must be performant out-of-the-box.

**Usability:**
The platform must be highly intuitive, especially for non-technical or semi-technical users. The learning curve should be minimal, allowing creators to be productive almost immediately.

**Scalability:**
While we are focused on the POC, the core architectural decisions should not prevent future scaling. The system should be designed with the long-term vision of supporting many "10xers" in mind.

**Reliability:**
The platform must be stable. Given the "short on time" constraint, we should lean on proven technologies and patterns to ensure the POC is robust and dependable.

**Security:**
Standard security practices are a must. This includes secure user authentication, authorization for accessing resources, and ensuring that user data and generated code are handled safely.

## User Interaction and Design Goals

**Overall Vision & Experience:** The UI should feel "living" and "sentient"â€”modern, sleek, and glassy with liquid-smooth animations. The aesthetic is dynamic, highly responsive, and gives the impression that the interface itself is intelligent.

**Key Interaction Paradigms:**

**Pervasive AI:** "Everything is an interface." AI assistance will be deeply embedded into all UI components, including "tooltip agents" and "context menu agents."

**Multiple Assistance Modes:** Users can interact with AI via a non-intrusive "magic dot," a persistent "copilot sidebar," and by expanding nodes on a canvas into dedicated UIs (chat, docs, whiteboard).

**Rich Controls:** The experience must support power-user features like drag-and-drop and keyboard shortcuts, alongside modern interactions like voice controls and proactive, context-aware suggestions.

**Core Screens/Views (Conceptual):** The structure will include a main Dashboard, a Project/Kanban Board, and the primary "Collaboratory" view. Critically, the system will support distinct "worlds" or sub-pages for each organization and project, creating contained environments.

**Target Devices/Platforms:** The platform will be designed with a "mobile-first" responsive philosophy, ensuring a seamless experience on any device, but with a primary focus on rich interactions on desktop.

## Technical Assumptions

**Repository & Service Architecture:** The project will be developed within a Turborepo monorepo. This structure will house both the Next.js frontend and the FastAPI (Python) backend, facilitating rapid, coordinated development, as demonstrated in the "Collaboratory" prototype.

**Preferred Technologies:** The project will prioritize the use of Next.js, Drizzle, Tailwind CSS, Radix, Framer Motion, Three.js, R3F, Drei, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, pnpm, pdm, uv, Docker, FastAPI, NestJS, LangGraph, Langflow, and AutoGPT.

**Deployment Platforms:** Deployment will be flexible, with potential targets including AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Fly.io, Heroku, and Railway.

**Testing requirements:** For the MVP/POC, the testing strategy will focus on unit and integration tests as defined in the "Collaboratory" prototype (pytest for backend, pnpm test for frontend). Comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) testing is planned for post-POC.

## Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP

An infinite canvas with linked nodes.
A Notion-like editor.
A tldraw-like whiteboard.
Real-time embodied agents (e.g., via Agora).
A formal End-to-End (E2E) testing suite.

## Epic Overview

### Epic 1: The Aigency Collaboratory & Development Core

Goal: To establish the core conversational interface where users can collaborate with the AI agent squad to brainstorm ideas, develop them into functional outputs (like SPAs), and manage the entire creative process in a single, fluid environment. This is the heart of the "sentient UI" and the AI-powered development experience.
Stories:
1.1: As a solo developer, I want to start a new project and describe my goal for a simple web application to the Aigency Squad, so that they can understand my vision and begin the development process.
1.2: As a solo developer, after my initial request is understood, I want the Aigency Squad to create the foundational file and folder structure for my new web application, so that I can see tangible progress and have a correct starting point for development.
1.3: As a solo developer, after the project scaffolding is created, I want the Aigency Squad to generate the initial boilerplate code for the main application entry points, so that the application is runnable and I can see a "hello world" equivalent.
1.4: As a solo developer, now that I have a running application, I want to ask the Aigency Squad to add a functional contact form to my personal portfolio site, so that visitors can send me messages.

### Epic 2: Agile Project Management

Goal: To provide users with a simple and intuitive Kanban board to manage the workflow of their projects. This includes visualizing the work from high-level epics down to individual tasks handled by the developer agents.
Stories:
2.1: As a user, I want to view a Kanban board for my project that displays the Epics and User Stories we've defined, so that I can have a clear, high-level overview of the project plan.
2.2: As a user, I want to drag and drop story cards on the Kanban board into different columns, so that I can easily update their status and reflect the current state of the project.

### Epic 3: Prototyping & Visualization Showcase

Goal: To create a dedicated feature where users can display, review, and share the outputs generated by the Aigency squad, such as data visualizations, reports, and interactive application prototypes.
Stories:
3.1: As a user, after the Aigency Squad generates a web application, I want to see it rendered in a live, interactive preview pane within the platform, so that I can immediately test the output without needing to deploy it myself.
3.2: As a user, I want to ask the Aigency Squad to create a data visualization from one of my uploaded files, and have the resulting chart displayed in the Showcase.

## Product Requirements Document: XPRT (Proof of Concept)

**Product Name:** Aigency XPRT

**Version:** 0.1 (Proof of Concept)

**Date:** April 21, 2025

**Author:** Gemini (summarizing conversation with User)

### 1. Introduction

XPRT is an AI-powered platform designed to guide users from an initial product idea to a ready-to-track project backlog and foundational branding. The goal is to significantly reduce the friction and expertise required to initiate a new product development effort, taking users from "zero to one" efficiently and conversationally.

### 2. Goals (Proof of Concept)

The primary goal for the Proof of Concept (PoC) is to demonstrate Expert's core capabilities in a reliable manner, showing the user journey from idea conception through the creation of essential project artifacts.

- Enable users to articulate a product idea conversationally.

- Automate the generation of key initial project documents (PRD, FRD, ERD, DRD, etc.) based on the conversation.

- Provide a conversational interface for users to ask questions about the generated artifacts and their idea.

- Integrate web search capabilities to address knowledge gaps and incorporate external information.

- Convert the product idea and generated documents into a structured backlog with epics and tasks, including complexity scoring.

- Establish a knowledge base to capture and easily retrieve project-relevant information.

- Implement a basic conversational branding process to create foundational design system elements (atomic design base, design tokens).

- Incorporate a memory layer to provide persistent, personalized user experiences across interactions and agents.

- Showcase a distinct, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface.

### 3. Target Users

The target user demographic is a foundational consideration, as it will heavily influence branding, voice, and user experience. While the specific demographic needs further definition, the system should cater to creators and innovators who have product ideas but may lack formal product management, design, or technical documentation expertise. The platform should guide them effectively regardless of their prior experience level.

### 4. Features (Proof of Concept Scope)

The following features are critical for the initial PoC:

- **Conversational Document Generation:**

    - Agent capability to interact with the user about their product idea.

    - Reliable generation of initial documents (PRD, FRD, potentially ERD, DRD) based on conversational input.

    - Presentation of generated documents to the user within the interface.

- **Knowledge Gap Filling (Web Search):**

    - Agent capability to identify information needed to refine the product idea or documents.

    - Integration with web search to retrieve relevant information.

    - Ability to present the process/reasoning steps of the web search if a full embedded browser is not feasible for V1.

    - Capability to ingest retrieved information into the user's knowledge base.

- **Backlog & Task Creation:**

    - Process to convert the developed idea/documents into a structured project backlog.

    - Creation of Epics and breakdown into sequential, sensible Tasks.

    - Assignment of complexity scores (weighted) to tasks/epics.

    - Presentation of the backlog, potentially as a Kanban-like view (Kanban board mentioned).

    - Display of up-to-date project progress.

- **Knowledge Base:**

    - System to capture knowledge related to the user's idea/project (from conversation, web search, user input).

    - Vector store association for each user account.

    - Natural language interface (chat) for easy knowledge retrieval.

    - Ability to retrieve specific articles, documents, or facts captured.

    - Basic agent to interact with the knowledge base.

    - Visualization of the knowledge base (at least a 2D representation).

- **Conversational Branding & Design System:**

    - Agent capability to discuss branding based on the (hypothetically identified) target user demographic.

    - Creation of basic atomic design system elements.

    - Generation of core design tokens (e.g., color palette, typography scale, spacing units).

- **Memory Layer:**

    - Integration of a memory system (e.g., leveraging Mem0) to remember user preferences, habits, and key attributes.

    - Shared memory accessible by all agents interacting with the user.

    - Agents leverage memory to provide personalized interactions and deepen their understanding of the user over time.

- **Document Editor:**

    - Basic interface to review and potentially edit the generated documents.

### 5. Success Metrics (Proof of Concept)

Success for the PoC will be measured by a combination of cost efficiency, user adoption, and feature engagement:

- **Cost:** Maintain total operating cost as low as possible (ideally near zero) until a viable number of profitable users is reached.

- **User Adoption:**

    - Number of user accounts created.

- **Milestone Completion:**

    - Number/Percentage of users who start a conversation and successfully reach key milestones (e.g., having a generated backlog, having a basic design system).

- **User Engagement:**

    - Login frequency / regularity of system usage.

    - Number of knowledge retrievals per user.

    - Amount of data ingested by users into their vector stores.

    - Frequency of using the ingested data.

    - Estimated time saved for users compared to manual processes.

    - Efficiency: Number of steps required for a user to reach a specific milestone (fewer steps being better).

### 6. UX/UI Vision

The user interface should embody the following characteristics:

- **Overall Tone:** Bold, Minimal, Futuristic.

- **Communication:** Approachable, Innovative, Advanced yet Easy-to-Use, Intuitive, Sleek.

- **Design Elements:**

    - Incorporation of Neumorphism, Skeuomorphism, and Glassmorphism principles.

    - Large, inviting, tactile-feeling controls (switches, buttons, knobs).

    - Use of glass panes for elements like tooltips, sidebars, or navigation, potentially with slight transparency.

    - Clear visual hierarchy where important elements "lift off the page" or are otherwise visually distinct and easy to identify.

### 7. Technical Considerations

- **Agent Frameworks:** Utilize Agent Zero (H0) and the Rue Commander team (Windsurf fork of VS Code).

- **Development Strategy:** Leverage the ability of the two agent systems to work simultaneously on features without dependencies.

- **Memory Layer:** Explore and integrate a library like MemZero for persistent user memory. Ensure memory is shared and accessible across all agents.

- **Knowledge Base Storage:** Likely requires a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate - mentioned as possibilities) for efficient storage and retrieval of user-specific knowledge.

- **LLM Integration:** Integration with language models for conversation, document generation, task breakdown, complexity scoring, and potentially branding tone analysis. (Implicit, but necessary).

### 8. Timeline

- **Proof of Concept (V1):** As soon as possible (ASAP). Prioritize the core features listed above to get a functional, demonstrable version ready quickly.
