# This Python script is a Statement of Work (SOW) generator that helps create professional project documentation through a simple command-line interface.

# Here's what it does in simple terms:

# 1. **Data Structure**: The code defines two main data models:
#    - `Milestone`: Tracks project checkpoints with descriptions, due dates, and who's responsible
#    - `StatementOfWork`: The complete document structure with all project details

# 2. **User Interaction**: The program asks you questions about your project:
#    - Basic info (project title, client name, manager, dates)
#    - Project objectives
#    - Scope items (what's included)
#    - Deliverables (what you'll produce)
#    - Milestones (key checkpoints with dates)
#    - Optional assumptions and approval information

# 3. **Data Validation**: It uses Pydantic to ensure data quality, like checking that the project title is at least 5 characters long.

# 4. **Document Creation**: After collecting all information, it:
#    - Formats everything into a professional template
#    - Shows you the completed document
#    - Saves it as a text file named after your project

# 5. **Error Handling**: If any information doesn't meet requirements, it shows a helpful error message.

# The code is well-structured with separate sections for data models, document templates, user interaction, formatting helpers, and the main process flow. It's designed to make creating standardized project documentation quick and error-free.

# ========== DATA STRUCTURES ========== #
# Define what a project milestone looks like
class Milestone(BaseModel):
    description: str      # What needs to be done
    due_date: str         # When it's due (as string for flexibility)
    owner: Optional[str] = None  # Who's responsible (optional)

# Blueprint for the entire Statement of Work document
class StatementOfWork(BaseModel):
    project_title: str     # Name of the project
    client_name: str       # Who we're doing it for
    project_manager: str   # Who's in charge
    start_date: str        # Project start date
    end_date: str          # Project end date
    objectives: str        # What we aim to achieve
    scope: List[str]       # What's included in the project
    deliverables: List[str]  # What we'll actually produce
    milestones: List[Milestone]  # Key project checkpoints
    assumptions: Optional[List[str]] = None  # Things we're assuming
    approval: Optional[str] = None  # Who signs off

# ========== DOCUMENT TEMPLATE ========== #
# This is our SOW form that will auto-fill with user answers
