# Multi-Source Monitoring Dashboard API Research - Comprehensive Analysis

## Research Overview
I conducted an extensive investigation into APIs and technical requirements for building a multi-source monitoring dashboard. The research covered 10+ different platforms across data sources and publishing APIs, along with comprehensive technical architecture recommendations.

## Key Findings

### Data Source APIs Analysis
**High Priority Recommendations:**
- **Hacker News API**: Excellent choice - free, reliable, no authentication required, simple REST interface
- **Reddit API**: Strong option - OAuth2 required, 100 QPM free tier, rich discussion data
- **News APIs**: Two viable options:
  - GNews API: €49.99/month, 1,000 requests/day (more affordable)
  - News API: $449/month, 250,000 requests/month (enterprise-grade)

**Lower Priority:**
- **Product Hunt API**: GraphQL interface, requires business contact for commercial use
- **Peerlist API**: Currently unavailable (no public API)

### Publishing APIs Analysis
**Recommended Platforms:**
1. **WordPress REST API**: Mature, extensive documentation, Application Passwords authentication
2. **Ghost API**: Modern, developer-friendly, JWT authentication, both Admin and Content APIs
3. **Dev.to API**: Simple integration, free, good for developer community reach

**Limited Options:**
- **Medium API**: Severely limited/deprecated for publishing
- **Substack API**: Not currently available (no public timeline)

### Technical Architecture Recommendations

**Stack Selection:**
- **Backend**: FastAPI (recommended) - excellent performance, automatic documentation
- **Frontend**: Next.js - modern React framework with SSR capabilities
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended over MongoDB) - better for complex relationships, ACID compliance, JSON support
- **Task Scheduling**: Celery (production) or APScheduler (simpler alternative)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude, or local LLMs via Ollama

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
Next.js Frontend ↔ FastAPI Backend ↔ PostgreSQL Database
                        ↓
                   Celery/Redis (Task Queue)
                        ↓
                 External APIs (Rate Limited)
```

### Rate Limiting & Compliance Strategy
- **Centralized Rate Limiter**: Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- **Request Scheduling**: Priority queue system for managing multiple APIs
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data minimization, retention policies, anonymization
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, compliance alerting

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1 Priority (Weeks 1-4)
1. FastAPI + Next.js foundation
2. PostgreSQL setup with core schema
3. Basic authentication and Docker configuration

### Phase 2 Priority (Weeks 5-8)
1. Hacker News integration (free, reliable)
2. Reddit OAuth implementation
3. Rate limiting infrastructure

### Phase 3 Priority (Weeks 9-12)
1. WordPress REST API integration
2. Ghost API implementation
3. Multi-platform publishing system

## Cost Analysis
**Monthly Operational Costs:**
- News APIs: $449-500/month for comprehensive coverage
- AI Services: $50-200/month (usage-based)
- Infrastructure: $200-500/month
- **Total**: ~$700-1,200/month for production system

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Dependencies**: Multiple fallback sources implemented
- **Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive compliance system
- **Security**: JWT authentication, proper CORS, HTTPS enforcement
- **Scalability**: Containerized architecture, horizontal scaling capability

## Technical Implementation
The research includes detailed code examples for:
- Multi-API rate limiting system
- OAuth2 implementation for Reddit
- WordPress/Ghost publishing workflows  
- Celery task scheduling
- FastAPI + Next.js integration patterns
- GDPR-compliant data handling

## Compliance Framework
- Platform-specific ToS compliance monitoring
- Automated data retention policies
- Privacy-by-design implementation
- Real-time compliance alerting system

The research provides a complete technical foundation for building a production-ready multi-source monitoring dashboard with intelligent publishing capabilities, backed by comprehensive API documentation and implementation strategies.
