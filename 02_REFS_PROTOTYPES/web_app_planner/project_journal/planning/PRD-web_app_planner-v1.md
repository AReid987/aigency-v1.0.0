## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance

- Initial application load time: < 5 seconds on a standard broadband connection
- UI interactions (e.g., opening sections, typing): No perceptible lag
- Data save/load operations: Visual feedback (loader) provided; operations should ideally complete within 2-3 seconds

### NFR2: Security

- RLS policies must verify auth.uid() matches the user_id column in relevant tables
- Clerk JWT must be properly configured to work with Supabase RLS policies
- All communication with Supabase and Clerk services MUST use HTTPS

### NFR3: Scalability

- Supabase is built on PostgreSQL which provides robust scaling capabilities
- Database connection pooling should be implemented for high-traffic scenarios
- Implement proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- The application architecture is designed for per-user workbook instances

### NFR4: Usability

- Interface MUST be intuitive and require minimal learning curve for target users
- All form fields and sections MUST have clear labels and beginner-friendly descriptive helper text
- Navigation MUST be consistent and predictable
- Animations should enhance UX without causing distraction or delay

### NFR5: Maintainability
- Code SHOULD be organized using modern React patterns with clear component responsibilities
- State management should follow best practices (React Context, SWR/React Query, or similar)
- Styling SHOULD primarily use Tailwind utility classes with component abstractions where appropriate
- Database schema should be well-documented with clear relationships

### NFR6: Accessibility (A11Y)

- Strive for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for basic elements:
  - Sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements in both light and dark modes
  - Keyboard navigability for all interactive elements (sidebar, buttons, inputs, dynamic list actions)
  - ARIA attributes used where appropriate for semantic meaning
  - Radix UI components should be leveraged for their built-in accessibility features

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------------------------------|------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low User Adoption | Medium | High | Intuitive UI/UX, clear value proposition, gather user feedback early and iterate. Focus on beginner-friendly guidance. |
| Data Loss/Corruption | Low | Medium | Utilize Supabase's backup features and PostgreSQL reliability. Implement robust error handling for data operations. |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Medium | High | Implement strict RLS policies, HTTPS, regular review of Supabase and Clerk best practices, input sanitization. |
| Scope Creep during MVP Dev | Medium | Medium | Adhere strictly to the defined MVP scope. Maintain a clear "Out of Scope" list. Prioritize core functionality. |
| Technical Debt | Medium | Medium | Follow maintainability guidelines (NFR5), conduct code reviews, refactor as needed post-MVP. |
| Browser Compatibility Issues | Low | Medium | Test on modern evergreen browsers. Use standard web technologies. Graceful degradation for minor unsupported features. |

## 9. Roadmap

### Q2 2025 (MVP Launch & Initial Iteration)

- Launch WebApp Planning Workbook MVP with all features defined in "In Scope"
- Monitor initial usage, gather early feedback via simple channels (e.g., contact email)
- Bug fixing and performance optimizations based on initial usage

### Q3 2025 (Enhancements & Foundation for Growth)

- #### Feature:
  - Implement a basic user feedback mechanism within the app (e.g., simple survey or feedback form)
- #### Exploration:
  - Proof-of-concept for AI-assisted content suggestions for one simple section (e.g., generating example user stories based on goals)
- #### Enhancement:
  - Improve responsive design for tablet and mobile views
- #### Technical:
  - Review and refine Supabase data structures based on early usage patterns

### Q4 2025 (Expanding Value)

- #### Feature:
  - Develop "Export to Markdown" functionality for key sections
- #### AI Integration:
  - Expand AI assistance to one more section if PoC is successful and user feedback is positive
- #### Community:
  - Consider a simple way for users to share read-only versions of their workbooks (e.g., shareable link with a unique token)

### Post Q4 2025 (Long-Term Vision Execution)

- Full AI-assisted content generation across multiple sections
- Advanced design system management features
- Enhanced collaboration tools (beyond read-only sharing)
- Potential integrations with other development tools
- Export to PDF

## 10. Compliance & Governance

- ### Data Privacy:
  - The application is designed with user privacy in mind. Authentication through Clerk minimizes direct PII handling. All user-generated workbook content is considered private to the user
- ### Data Security:
  - #### User data is protected through:
    - Supabase Row Level Security ensuring users can only access their own data
    - Encryption at rest and in transit provided by Supabase and Clerk
- ### Data Ownership:
  - Users own the content they create within their workbooks
- ### No Sale of Data:
  - User data or content will not be sold to third parties

## 11. Next Steps (Post-PRD Approval)

1. ### Finalize UI/UX Design:
  - Create detailed mockups for all sections and interactions, ensuring consistency with the Atomic Design principles outlined
2. ### Set up Development Environment:
  - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and other dependencies
3. ### Supabase & Clerk Setup:
  - Create Supabase project, define database schema, configure RLS policies, and set up Clerk authentication
4. ### Implement Core Authentication:
  - Develop and test Clerk sign-in flow and token handling
5. ### Build Section by Section:
  - Start with one core section (e.g., Branding)
  - Implement data input forms, dynamic list management, and Supabase save/load functionality
  - Test thoroughly before moving to the next section
6. ### Implement Theme Toggle:
  - Develop dark/light mode switching and persistence in Supabase
7. ### Integrate Navigation & UI Feedback:
  - Ensure sidebar navigation, active state highlighting, toast notifications, and loading indicators are functional
8. ### Testing & QA:
