    - Priya approves the suggestion, and a basic Next.js prototype is generated

5. Review & Iteration:

    - Priya reviews all generated artifacts on the xyFlow canvas

    - She provides feedback on specific elements

    - Agents incorporate feedback and refine the outputs

6. Export & Next Steps:
