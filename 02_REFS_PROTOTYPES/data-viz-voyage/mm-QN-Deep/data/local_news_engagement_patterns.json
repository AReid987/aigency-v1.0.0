{"extracted_information": "Report from Pew Research Center, dated May 7, 2024, based on a survey of 5,146 U.S. adults conducted Jan. 22-28, 2024, as part of the American Trends Panel. The report examines Americans' habits and attitudes toward local news, comparing findings to a 2018 study. Key findings include shifts towards digital news consumption, declining attention to local news (mirroring national trends), continued positive views of local news importance and journalists, low rates of payment for local news despite perceived financial health, and differing views on the role of local journalists by age and party. The survey sample was recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses and weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education, and other categories.", "specifications": {"survey_date": "Jan. 22-28, 2024", "report_date": "May 7, 2024", "sample_size": "5,146 U.S. adults", "survey_methodology": "American Trends Panel (ATP), online survey panel recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses, weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population."}, "pricing": {"paid_for_local_news_in_past_year": "15% of Americans", "reason_for_not_paying": "Most common explanation is finding plenty of free local news; young adults are more inclined to say they aren't interested enough to pay."}, "features": [], "statistics": {"attention_to_local_news": {"follow_very_closely_2024": "22%", "follow_very_closely_2016": "37%", "follow_at_least_somewhat_closely_2024": "66%"}, "importance_of_local_news": {"at_least_somewhat_important_to_community_well_being": "85%", "extremely_or_very_important_to_community_well_being": "44%"}, "views_of_local_journalists_and_outlets": {"local_journalists_mostly_in_touch_with_community_2024": "69%", "local_journalists_mostly_in_touch_with_community_2018": "63%", "local_media_doing_well_at_reporting_news_accurately_overall": "71%", "local_media_doing_well_at_covering_most_important_stories_overall": "68%", "local_media_doing_well_at_being_transparent_overall": "63%", "local_media_doing_well_at_keeping_eye_on_local_political_leaders_overall": "61%", "local_media_doing_well_at_reporting_news_accurately_democrats": "78%", "local_media_doing_well_at_reporting_news_accurately_republicans": "66%"}, "financial_health_of_local_news_outlets": {"doing_very_or_somewhat_well_financially_2024": "63%", "doing_very_or_somewhat_well_financially_2018": "71%", "not_doing_too_well_or_not_doing_well_at_all_financially_2024": "33%"}, "preferred_pathways_to_local_news": {"television_2024": "32%", "television_2018": "41%", "news_websites_2024": "26% (increase from prior years)", "social_media_2024": "23% (increase from prior years)", "print_newspaper_2024": "9%", "radio_2024": "9%"}, "sources_for_local_news_often_or_sometimes_used": {"local_television_stations_2024": "64%", "local_television_stations_2018": "70%", "online_forums_facebook_groups_nextdoor_2024": "52%", "online_forums_facebook_groups_nextdoor_2018": "38% (increase of 14 percentage points)", "local_radio_stations_2024": "52%", "daily_newspaper_print_online_or_social_media_2024": "33%", "daily_newspaper_print_online_or_social_media_2018": "43% (decrease of 10 points)", "local_government_agencies_2024": "35%", "local_newsletters_or_listservs_2024": "31%"}, "access_method_for_local_daily_newspapers_among_their_readers": {"print_2024": "31%", "digitally_websites_apps_emails_social_media_2024": "66%", "print_2018": "54%", "digitally_websites_apps_emails_social_media_2018": "43%"}, "access_method_for_local_tv_news_among_their_viewers": {"through_television_set_2024": "62%", "through_digital_pathways_2024": "37%", "through_television_set_2018": "76%"}, "views_on_role_of_local_journalists": {"should_remain_neutral_on_community_issues": "69%", "should_advocate_for_change_in_communities": "29%", "should_advocate_ages_18_29": "39%", "should_advocate_ages_30_49": "34%"}, "community_connection_vs_engagement_and_views": {"local_news_extremely_or_very_important_very_attached_to_community": "66%", "local_news_extremely_or_very_important_somewhat_attached_to_community": "46%", "local_news_extremely_or_very_important_not_very_or_not_at_all_attached_to_community": "31%"}}, "temporal_info": {"survey_conduct_period": "January 22 to 28, 2024", "report_publication_date": "May 7, 2024", "comparisons_made_to_years": ["2016", "2018", "2022"]}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": ["Similar study conducted in 2018 (Pew Research Center)", "Topline for survey questions and responses", "Methodology document for ATP and this survey", "Pew Research Center report 'Partisan divides in media trust widen...'
