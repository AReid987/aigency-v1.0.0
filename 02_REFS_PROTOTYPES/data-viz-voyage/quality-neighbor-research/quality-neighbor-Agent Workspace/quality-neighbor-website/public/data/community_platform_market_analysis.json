These tools are adopted by businesses of all sizes to improve communication and strengthen ties with customers and employees. The market saw a positive effect during the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased demand for digital interaction as companies sought new features and services to stay connected. This shift also encouraged updates to regulations and policies. A major trend driving the market is the rise of AI-powered personalization, which boosts engagement by offering tailored experiences like recommending content and connecting users with similar interests. This provides businesses with better insights into user behavior.
