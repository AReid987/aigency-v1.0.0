# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Draft - uXPRT

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the initial product requirements for uXPRT, a simplified version of the Knowledge OS (XPRT). uXPRT aims to streamline the UX Pipeline for users by providing conversational agents that assist in generating key product development and content creation artifacts.

## 2. Goals

- To provide users with a conversational interface to navigate the UX Pipeline.
- To automatically generate essential product development and content creation artifacts (PRD, FRD, DRD, ERD, diagrams, wireframes, sitemaps, GTM Strategy, Lean Canvas, Basic Atomic Design System, Brand voice & Tone, Core values, Brand Identity, Brand Book).
- To enable users to download or manage generated artifacts within the application.
- To implement automatic versioning for all generated artifacts.
- To integrate AI agent assistance for guidance and artifact generation.
- To include a web search capability for research purposes.
- To reduce the time and effort required for users to complete the UX Pipeline.
- To achieve positive user feedback, high user adoption, and retention.

## 3. Scope

uXPRT will focus on the core functionality of providing conversational agent guidance and automated artifact generation for the UX Pipeline. This includes user interaction with agents, artifact generation based on user input and requirements, artifact management, versioning, and web search integration. Out of scope for the initial version are advanced collaboration features, complex customization options for artifacts, and integrations beyond the specified technical stack (Next.js, Python, FastAPI, Google ADK, Supabase).

## 4. User Stories/Personas

**Target Users:** Startup founders, solopreneurs, small business owners, content creators, and marketers.
