# UI Concepts: Diagrams, Wireframes, and Sitemap

## üéØ Objective

This document outlines initial conceptual ideas for key diagrams, core screen wireframes, and the sitemap for the uXPRT project, based on the project requirements and user personas.

## üìä Diagrams

### System Context Diagram (Conceptual)

- **Purpose:** To show the uXPRT system in its environment, interacting with external entities.
- **Key Elements:**
  - **uXPRT System:** The central system.
  - **User:** Interacts with the system via a conversational interface.
  - **External APIs (e.g., Web Search):** Provides data to the system.
  - **Data Storage (e.g., Supabase):** Stores user data and generated artifacts.
  - **AI Models (e.g., Google ADK):** Used for conversational AI and artifact generation.
- **Flow:** User interacts with uXPRT -> uXPRT uses AI models and external APIs -> uXPRT stores/retrieves data from storage -> uXPRT provides guidance and artifacts to the user.

### Basic User Flow Diagram (Conceptual)

- **Purpose:** To illustrate a core user journey, such as generating a PRD.
- **Key Steps:**
  1.  **User Initiates Task:** User selects or requests to generate a PRD via the conversational interface.
  2.  **Agent Gathers Information:** The AI agent asks the user a series of questions based on PRD requirements (e.g., product name, target audience, features).
  3.  **User Provides Input:** User answers the agent's questions.
  4.  **Agent Processes Information:** The AI agent processes the user's input.
  5.  **Agent Generates PRD:** The system generates the PRD document.
  6.  **User Reviews/Edits PRD:** User can review and make edits to the generated PRD via the UI.
  7.  **User Saves/Downloads PRD:** User saves the PRD within the app or downloads it.

## üì± Wireframes (Core Screens - Conceptual)

### 1. Dashboard/Home Screen

- **Layout:**
  - Header: App logo, user profile/settings.
  - Sidebar (Optional or Collapsible): Navigation to different sections (e.g., Dashboard, Artifacts, Settings).
  - Main Content Area:
    - Prominent conversational agent interface (chat window).
    - Quick access/suggested actions based on user history or common tasks (e.g., "Generate a PRD", "Define User Personas").
    - Overview of recent activity or generated artifacts.
- **Key Elements:** Chat input field, agent response area, suggested prompts/buttons, list of recent items.

### 2. Artifacts Library Screen

- **Layout:**
  - Header: App logo, user profile/settings.
  - Sidebar (Optional or Collapsible): Navigation.
  - Main Content Area:
    - Filter/Sort options for artifacts (by type, date, project).
    - Search bar.
    - Grid or list view of generated artifacts with previews or key information (e.g., title, type, date created).
    - Options to view, edit, download, or delete artifacts.
- **Key Elements:** Filter/sort controls, search bar, artifact cards/list items, action buttons (view, edit, download, delete).

### 3. Artifact Detail/Edit Screen

- **Layout:**
  - Header: App logo, user profile/settings, "Back to Library" button.
  - Main Content Area:
    - Display of the generated artifact (e.g., markdown for PRD, visual representation for diagram/sitemap).
    - Editing interface (if applicable and feasible within the UI).
    - Options to download, share, or regenerate the artifact.
    - Contextual conversational agent access for questions or further assistance related to the artifact.
- **Key Elements:** Artifact display area, edit controls, action buttons (download, share, regenerate), integrated chat interface.

## üó∫Ô∏è Sitemap (Conceptual)

- **Structure:** Hierarchical representation of the main sections and pages of the uXPRT application.
- **Key Pages:**
  - Home/Dashboard (Landing page after login)
  - Artifacts Library
    - Artifact Detail/Edit Page (for each artifact type: PRD, FRD, Diagram, Wireframe, Sitemap, etc.)
  - Settings
    - User Profile
    - Account Settings
    - Integrations (if any)
  - Help/Support
  - Login/Signup (Outside the main application flow)

## ‚ú® Design Considerations

- **Conversational First:** The UI should prioritize the conversational agent as the primary mode of interaction for generating artifacts and getting guidance.
- **Simplicity:** Given the target audience, the interface should be clean, intuitive, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Visual Clarity:** Generated diagrams, wireframes, and sitemaps should be presented in a clear, easy-to-understand visual format within the application.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG principles to ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities.
- **Responsiveness:** The UI should be responsive and work well on various device sizes.
