# Architecture Document: uXPRT

## Overview

This document outlines the initial architectural considerations for the uXPRT application, focusing on addressing the key non-functional requirements: Performance, Security, Scalability, and Data Privacy.

## Non-Functional Requirements Architecture

### Performance

To ensure high performance and minimal latency, the architecture will incorporate:

- **Optimized API Design:** FastAPI will be used for the backend API due to its high performance and asynchronous capabilities.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Complex tasks like artifact generation will be handled asynchronously using background jobs or message queues to avoid blocking the main request thread.
- **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data and potentially for generated artifacts to reduce regeneration time.
- **Efficient Data Access:** Optimize database queries and utilize appropriate indexing with Supabase.
- **Frontend Performance:** Leverage Next.js capabilities for server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where appropriate, and optimize frontend assets.

### Security

Security will be a core consideration throughout the architecture:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement secure user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) using Supabase Auth.
- **Data Protection:** Encrypt sensitive user data at rest within the Supabase database and ensure secure transmission using HTTPS.
- **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all user inputs on the backend to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management:** Maintain up-to-date dependencies to mitigate known security risks.
- **Security Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security events.

### Scalability

The architecture is designed for horizontal scalability:

- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Deploy on a cloud platform that supports auto-scaling of application instances and database resources.
- **Load Balancing:** Utilize load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application.
- **Database Scalability:** Leverage Supabase's managed Postgres, considering features like connection pooling and potential read replicas as needed.
- **Modular Design:** Structure the application into modular components or services that can be scaled independently based on demand (e.g., separate services for the conversational agent, artifact generation, and web search).
- **Message Queues:** Use message queues (e.g., built into cloud platforms or separate services) to handle asynchronous tasks and buffer load during traffic spikes.

### Data Privacy

Adherence to data privacy regulations will be built into the system:

- **Compliance:** Design the system with consideration for relevant regulations like GDPR and CCPA, ensuring data handling practices align with legal requirements.
- **Consent Management:** Implement mechanisms to obtain and manage user consent for data processing.
- **Data Minimization:** Collect only the data necessary to provide the uXPRT service.
- **User Data Control:** Provide users with features to access, modify, and delete their personal data and generated artifacts.
- **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Explore opportunities to anonymize or pseudonymize data where full identification is not required for functionality.
- **Secure Storage and Disposal:** Ensure secure storage of data and implement policies for secure data disposal when no longer needed.
