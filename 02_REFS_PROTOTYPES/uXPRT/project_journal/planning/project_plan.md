# Project Plan: uXPRT

## üéØ Objective Summary

uXPRT is a simplified version of XPRT, the Knowledge OS, focused on providing a conversational agent team to guide users through the UX Pipeline. It aims to speed up product development and content creation by automatically generating various artifacts.

## ‚ú® Key Features Summary

The core features involve a conversational agent team assisting users in:

- Defining target demographic and creating user personas.
- Generating product documentation (PRD, FRD, DRD, ERD).
- Creating diagrams, wireframes, and sitemaps.
- Developing GTM strategy, Lean Canvas, Basic Atomic Design System, Brand voice & Tone, Core values, Brand Identity, and Brand Book.
- Providing web search capabilities for research.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Considerations

Based on user feedback, the following technologies and frameworks are being considered:

- **Agent Frameworks:** BrowserUse, BlastAI, Open Manus, Proxy Light, Skyvern, Open Operator, Hyperbrowser, Agno, AG2, Magentic One, Suna AI
- **MCP Web Search:** Tavily, Exa, Webresearch, Serper, puppeteer, playwright, stagehand, browserbase
- **Documentation Schema:** zod, pydantic
- **ORM:** Prisma, Drizzle

Decisions on which specific technologies to use will be made during the relevant implementation tasks.
