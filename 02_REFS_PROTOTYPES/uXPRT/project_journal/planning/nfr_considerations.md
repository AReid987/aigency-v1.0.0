# Non-Functional Requirements Considerations: uXPRT

This document outlines initial considerations and strategies for addressing key non-functional requirements for the uXPRT project, referencing the requirements defined in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md`.

## Performance

Referenced in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md` (Line 31): "The application should be highly performant, with minimal latency in agent responses and artifact generation."

Considerations:

- Optimize API response times for conversational agent interactions.
- Efficiently generate and process artifacts, potentially using asynchronous operations or background jobs for complex tasks.
- Minimize latency for web search queries.
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate (e.g., for frequently accessed data or generated artifacts).
- Monitor and profile application performance to identify bottlenecks.

Technical Approaches:

- Utilize efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Choose performant libraries and frameworks (Next.js, FastAPI are good starting points).
- Optimize database queries and indexing.
- Consider serverless functions for scalable and cost-effective artifact generation.
- Implement content delivery networks (CDNs) for static assets.

## Security

Referenced in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md` (Line 32): "Security is critical, especially regarding user data and generated intellectual property."

Considerations:

- Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Protect sensitive user data and generated artifacts from unauthorized access.
- Implement secure communication protocols (HTTPS).
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
- Implement logging and monitoring for security events.

Technical Approaches:

- Use industry-standard authentication libraries and practices.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
- Follow secure coding guidelines.

## Scalability

Referenced in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md` (Line 33): "The platform should be scalable to handle a growing number of users and generated artifacts."

Considerations:

- Design the architecture to be horizontally scalable, allowing for easy addition of resources as user load increases.
- Ensure the database can handle increasing data volume and query load.
- Scale conversational agent processing and artifact generation capabilities.
- Manage state effectively in a distributed environment.

Technical Approaches:

- Use a cloud-based infrastructure that supports auto-scaling (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
- Employ load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
- Utilize a scalable database solution (Supabase is a good starting point, consider read replicas or sharding if needed).
- Design microservices or modular components that can be scaled independently.
- Implement message queues for handling asynchronous tasks like artifact generation.

## Data Privacy

Referenced in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md` (Line 34): "Data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations are essential."

Considerations:

- Identify and comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Obtain necessary user consent for data collection and processing.
- Implement data minimization principles, collecting only necessary data.
- Provide users with control over their data (access, modification, deletion).
- Anonymize or pseudonymize data where possible.
- Securely store and dispose of data.

Technical Approaches:

- Implement data access controls and auditing.
- Encrypt sensitive data.
- Develop clear and accessible privacy policies.
- Build features for data export and deletion.
- Train development and operations teams on data privacy best practices.
