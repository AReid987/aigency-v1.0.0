# Task Log: TASK-API-MCP-BRAVE-INTEGRATION-20250508 - API Development

**Goal:** Integrate the Brave Search MCP tool into the existing search API controller.

---

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Modified `uxprt/src/search/controllers.py` to uncomment `use_mcp_tool` import and its usage for `brave-search`, removed placeholder response, and ensured `web_search` function is `async def`. Verified that `uxprt/src/search/routes.py` correctly includes the controller's router, which will handle the async nature of the endpoint.
**References:** [`uxprt/src/search/controllers.py`, `uxprt/src/search/routes.py`]
