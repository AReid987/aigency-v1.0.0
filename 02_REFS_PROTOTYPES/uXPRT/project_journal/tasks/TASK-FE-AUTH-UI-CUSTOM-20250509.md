## Description

Refine the custom UI for the authentication page to fully match the design inspiration and user feedback, including layout, theme colors, initial landing page behavior, a "Go back" button on the Signup form, and a background grid effect.

## Context

- User feedback indicated that the `/auth` page theme and layout did not match the inspiration.
- Specific issues included incorrect background color, auth form border, layout of elements (social buttons, OR separator, email/password fields), and initial landing page behavior.
- XPRT Logo: `uxprt/public/xprt-atom-logo-neg.svg`
- Color Palette: `project_journal/planning/theme_palette.md`
- Relevant Files: `uxprt/src/app/auth/page.tsx`, `uxprt/src/app/components/LoginForm.tsx`, `uxprt/src/app/components/SignupForm.tsx`, `uxprt/src/app/components/Header.tsx`, `uxprt/src/app/globals.css`, `uxprt/src/app/page.tsx`.

## Tasks Completed

1.  **Implement Landing Page Behavior:**
    - Modified `uxprt/src/app/page.tsx` to be a simple landing page, not showing the auth form.
    - Ensured `Header.tsx` displays a "Log in" button.
    - Verified the "Log in" button navigates to `/auth`. Removed redundant "Signup" button from header.
2.  **Refine Auth Page Layout (`/auth/page.tsx`):**
    - Removed the `Card` component wrapper around the auth form to eliminate the border, matching the inspiration.
    - Structured content as per inspiration: XPRT Logo and title, placeholder social sign-up buttons, "OR" separator, email/password form, "Sign in" button, and toggle link.
3.  **Correct Background Color:**
    - Verified `globals.css` correctly applies `--color-background: #101211;` (`--gray-1`) for the dark theme.
    - The "grid that fades" effect is noted as a potential future polish; a solid dark background is currently implemented.
4.  **Verify All Theme Colors:**
    - Checked `LoginForm.tsx`, `SignupForm.tsx`, and `auth/page.tsx` for correct application of theme colors (greens, grays from `theme_palette.md` via CSS variables in `globals.css`). Shadcn UI components correctly inherit these styles.
5.  **Test Navigation:**
    - Confirmed "Log in" button in header navigates to `/auth`.
    - Confirmed toggle between Login/Signup on `/auth` page works.
6.  **Add "Go back" Button to Signup View:**
    - Modified `uxprt/src/app/auth/page.tsx` to pass the `toggleForm` function to `SignupForm.tsx`.
    - Modified `uxprt/src/app/components/SignupForm.tsx` to:
      - Accept an `onGoBack` prop.
      - Display a "Go back" button (with an `ArrowLeft` icon) in the top-left area.
      - Call `onGoBack` when the button is clicked.
7.  **Implement Background Grid Effect:**
    - Added CSS rules to `uxprt/src/app/globals.css` within the `.dark body` selector to create a subtle grid pattern and a radial gradient fade from the top-right, using theme-appropriate colors.

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- [x] The `/` route displays a simple landing page.
- [x] The `Header.tsx` contains a "Log in" button that navigates to `/auth`.
- [x] The `/auth` page layout closely matches the design inspiration (logo, title, social buttons (placeholders), OR separator, email/password form).
- [x] The auth form on `/auth` does not have an explicit border.
- [x] The background color of the `/auth` page is `#101211`.
- [x] All other theme colors (greens, grays) are correctly applied to elements on the `/auth` page.
- [x] A "Go back" button is present and functional on the Signup portion of the `/auth` page.
- [x] The background of the `/auth` page displays the fading grid effect over the dark background color.
- [x] The application runs successfully with `pnpm dev` (verified by ongoing terminal output).

## Notes

- Social sign-up buttons are placeholders.
- Password reset functionality is a TODO in `LoginForm.tsx`.
