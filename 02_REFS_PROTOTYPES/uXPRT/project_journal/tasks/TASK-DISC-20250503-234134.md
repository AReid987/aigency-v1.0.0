# Task Log: TASK-DISC-20250503-234134 - Requirements Gathering: uXPRT

**Goal:** Gather detailed requirements for uXPRT.

## Objective Clarification

**Objective:** uXPRT is a simplified version of XPRT, the Knowledge OS, focused on providing a conversational agent team to guide users through the UX Pipeline. It aims to speed up product development and content creation by automatically generating artifacts such as PRDs, FRDs, DRDs, ERDs, software diagrams (C4 System Context, FlowCharts), wireframes, sitemaps, GTM Strategy, Lean Canvas, Basic Atomic Design System, Brand voice & Tone, Core values, Brand Identity, and Brand Book. These artifacts will be available for download or management via the app, with automatic versioning and AI agent assistance. The technology stack includes Next.js, Python, FastAPI, Google ADK, and Supabase. A web search capability is also required for research.

## Target Demographic

**Target Users:** Startup founders, solopreneurs, small business owners, content creators, and marketers.

## Key Features

The conversational agent team will provide guidance and assistance for:

- Defining target demographic and creating user personas.
- Generating product documentation (PRD, FRD, DRD, ERD).
- Creating diagrams, wireframes, and sitemaps.
- Developing GTM strategy, Lean Canvas, Basic Atomic Design System, Brand voice & Tone, Core values, Brand Identity, and Brand Book.

## User Flow

The expected user flow will be a combination of approaches:

- Users will initiate a conversation and be guided step-by-step through the UX pipeline process.
- Users will have the option to select specific tasks or artifacts they want assistance with from a menu.
- Users will provide information through a Q&A format, and the agent will generate the artifacts based on their input.
- The agent will proactively suggest next steps in the UX pipeline based on the user's progress.

## Data Handling

uXPRT will need to handle and process the following types of data:

- User input from conversations with the agents.
- Information used to generate product development and content creation artifacts.
- User account information for managing generated artifacts.
- Data from external web searches for research purposes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The application should be highly performant, with minimal latency in agent responses and artifact generation.
- **Security:** Security is critical, especially regarding user data and generated intellectual property.
- **Scalability:** The platform should be scalable to handle a growing number of users and generated artifacts.
- **Data Privacy:** Data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations are essential.

## Constraints and Limitations

The project has the following constraints and limitations:

- Budget constraints that might impact the choice of technologies or external services.
- Timeline limitations for the initial release or specific features.
- Technical limitations based on the chosen stack (Next.js, Python, FastAPI, Google ADK, Supabase).
- Integration requirements with existing tools or platforms.

## Success Criteria

Key success criteria for the uXPRT project include:

- Successful generation of all specified product development and content creation artifacts.
- Positive user feedback on the conversational agent's guidance and ease of use.
- Measurable reduction in the time and effort required for users to complete the UX pipeline.
- Growth in user adoption and retention.
