# Task Log: TASK-PM-20250504-004140 - Frontend Development

**Goal:** Set up the user interface framework for the uXPRT project.

# Task Log: TASK-PM-20250504-004140 - Basic Data Storage

**Goal:** Design and implement basic data storage mechanisms for the uXPRT project, considering ORM choices and documentation schemas.

**Goal:** Implement User Authentication for the uXPRT project.

# Task Log: TASK-PM-20250504-004140 - Project Management

**Goal:** Create a project backlog organized into Epics, with each Epic containing tasks. Each task should have a complexity score ranging from 1 to 10. The total sum of these complexity scores will be used to track the project's completion percentage.

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Created the initial project backlog with Epics and tasks, including complexity scores.
**References:** [`project_journal/planning/project_backlog.md` (created)]

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Designed and documented the API endpoints for user authentication in `docs/api/openapi.yaml`.
**References:** [`docs/api/openapi.yaml` (created)]

- Created basic Python route and controller files for authentication (`src/auth/routes.py`, `src/auth/controllers.py`). Note: ORM decision is pending; core logic implementation will proceed without it for now.

- Implemented core authentication logic (password hashing, token generation/decoding) in `src/auth/controllers.py`. Added placeholder logic for database interaction and token validation middleware in `src/auth/routes.py`.

- Created placeholder test file `tests/auth/test_auth.py`. Unit tests for password hashing and token handling can be added, but full integration tests require database implementation.

**Schema Implementation:** Created `src/db/schema.sql` with initial table definitions for `users`, `conversations`, `artifacts`, and `search_queries`, including primary keys, foreign keys, and basic indexes.

**Diagram Syntax:** Generated Mermaid ER diagram syntax for the defined schema.

**Testing:** Note that database migration and testing will need to be performed manually in a suitable environment.

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Implemented initial database schema in `src/db/schema.sql` based on the design in `project_journal/planning/db_schema_design.md`. Requested update to the database schema diagram. Manual migration and testing are required.
**References:** [`src/db/schema.sql`, `project_journal/planning/db_schema_design.md`, `project_journal/visualizations/database_schema.md` (update requested)]

# Task Log: TASK-PM-20250504-004140 - API Development

**Goal:** Implement search functionality, including core web search integration.
**Epic:** Advanced Features
**Complexity:** 7

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Implemented the /api/search endpoint in `src/search_api.py` and updated the OpenAPI documentation in `docs/api/openapi.yaml`. Added basic tests for the search endpoint in `tests/search/test_search.py`.
**References:** [`src/search_api.py` (modified), `docs/api/openapi.yaml` (modified), `tests/search/test_search.py` (created)]

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Implemented placeholder backend logic and API endpoints for user profiles in `src/user/controllers.py` and `src/user/routes.py`. Added placeholder tests in `tests/user/test_user.py`. Updated `docs/api/openapi.yaml` with the new user profile endpoints and schemas.
**References:** [`src/user/controllers.py` (created), `src/user/routes.py` (created), `tests/user/test_user.py` (created), `docs/api/openapi.yaml` (updated)]
