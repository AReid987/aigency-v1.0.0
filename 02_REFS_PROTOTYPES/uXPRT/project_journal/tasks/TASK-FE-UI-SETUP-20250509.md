# Task Log: Frontend UI Setup (TASK-FE-UI-SETUP-20250509)

**Date:** 2025-05-09
**Engineer:** Roo Next.js Developer

## Goal

Set up the User Interface framework for the Next.js application in the `uxprt` directory. This includes ensuring basic project structure, layout, and creating initial placeholder UI components for Login and Signup.

## Summary of Work

1.  **Reviewed Project Structure:**
    - Examined `uxprt/src/app/layout.tsx` and `uxprt/src/app/components/Header.tsx`.
2.  **Ensured Basic Layout:**
    - Modified `uxprt/src/app/components/Header.tsx` to include navigation links for "Home", "Login", and "Signup".
3.  **Authentication UI Setup:**
    - Created `uxprt/src/app/auth/page.tsx` to host both login and signup forms, with a toggle to switch between them. This page uses client-side rendering (`'use client'`).
    - Created `uxprt/src/app/components/LoginForm.tsx` with placeholder fields for email and password, using Shadcn UI's `Input`, `Label`, and `Button`.
    - Created `uxprt/src/app/components/SignupForm.tsx` with placeholder fields for email, password, and confirm password, using Shadcn UI's `Input`, `Label`, and `Button`.
    - Added missing Shadcn UI components:
      - Created `uxprt/src/components/ui/input.tsx`.
      - Created `uxprt/src/components/ui/label.tsx`.
      - Installed `@radix-ui/react-label` dependency via `pnpm add @radix-ui/react-label` in the `uxprt` directory.
4.  **Styling:**
    - Leveraged existing global styles from `uxprt/src/app/globals.css`.
    - Used Tailwind CSS classes for basic styling within the created components and pages, consistent with Shadcn UI.
    - The `AuthPage` uses a `Card` component for better visual structure.
5.  **Error Resolution:**
    - Resolved `Module not found` error for `components/ui/card` in `uxprt/src/app/auth/page.tsx` by adding the `Card` component using `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card`.
6.  **Runnability:**
    - The application should now be runnable with `pnpm dev` within the `uxprt` directory.
