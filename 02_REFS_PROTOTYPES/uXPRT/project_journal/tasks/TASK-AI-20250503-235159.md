# Task Log: TASK-AI-20250503-235159 - API Development

**Goal:** Plan implementation of conversational agent guidance logic based on the requirements in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md`.

## Plan

Based on the requirements in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md`, the plan for implementing the conversational agent guidance logic API includes:

1.  **Design API Endpoints:** Define endpoints for user interaction, artifact generation requests, and data retrieval.
2.  **Implement Core Logic:** Develop backend services to process user input, determine guidance, and trigger artifact generation.
3.  **Integrate with AI/ML Models:** Define data contracts and integration points for AI/ML services.
4.  **Integrate with Data Storage:** Plan data storage and retrieval for conversations, artifacts, and user data.
5.  **Implement Input Validation and Error Handling:** Add validation and error handling for API requests.
6.  **Implement Authentication/Authorization:** Secure API endpoints.
7.  **Document API:** Create or update API documentation.

## Implementation Plan Outline

- Create `src/agent/` directory.
- Define API endpoints (`/agent/chat`, `/agent/state`, `/agent/command`).
- Define Pydantic request/response schemas.
- Implement core NLU, Dialogue Management, and Response Generation logic.
- Implement integration with Data Handling, Artifact Generation, and Web Search services via internal API calls.
- Add logging for conversational flow and service interactions.

## Files Created

- `src/agent/routes.py`
- `src/agent/controllers.py`
