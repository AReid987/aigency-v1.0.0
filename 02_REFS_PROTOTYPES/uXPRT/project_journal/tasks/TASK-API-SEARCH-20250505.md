# Task Log: TASK-API-SEARCH-20250505 - Implement Backend Integration for Search Functionality

**Goal:** Implement the backend logic to integrate core web search functionality with the application, potentially involving storing search queries or results.

**Implementation:**

- Integrated Supabase client in `src/search_api.py` using the provided Service Role Key for project ID `vezfdsbhmfydqlhgyqul`.
- Modified the `/api/search` endpoint to store search queries and results in the `search_queries` table after a successful web search via the brave-search MCP tool.

# Task Log: TASK-API-SEARCH-20250505 - Backend Search Integration

**Goal:** Implement the backend logic to integrate the core web search functionality from `src/search_api.py` with the application, potentially including database interaction for queries/results, based on project plans. Review existing code and confirm plan.

**Implementation Plan Confirmed (2025-05-05 22:26):**

1.  **Refactor:** Move existing search logic (`src/search_api.py`) into a new `src/search/` module (`controllers.py`, `routes.py`). Delete `src/search_api.py`.
2.  **Integrate Auth:** Modify endpoint in `src/search/controllers.py` to require authentication and include `user_id` in DB inserts.
3.  **Mount Routes:** Update main FastAPI app to include the new search router.
4.  **Testing:** Update `tests/search/test_search.py`.
5.  **Logging:** Log progress here.

**Implementation Complete (2025-05-06 17:47):**

1.  Refactored search logic into `uxprt/src/search/controllers.py` and `uxprt/src/search/routes.py`.
2.  Integrated authentication using token_required decorator.
3.  Updated test file `uxprt/tests/search/test_search.py` to assert authentication is required.
4.  Corrected project file structure by moving `src/`, `tests/`, and `supabase/` into the `uxprt/` directory.
