# Task Log: TASK-ARCH-20250503-235159 - Address Non-Functional Requirements

**Goal:** Address initial non-functional requirements (Performance, Security, Scalability, Data Privacy) based on the requirements in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md`.

## Non-Functional Requirements Addressed

Based on `project_journal/planning/requirements.md`, the following non-functional requirements are addressed in the architecture:

### Performance

- **Requirement:** The application should be highly performant, with minimal latency in agent responses and artifact generation.
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Utilize FastAPI for the backend due to its high performance and asynchronous capabilities.
  - Implement efficient database queries and indexing using Supabase (Postgres).
  - Optimize AI model inference times by selecting appropriate models and potentially leveraging hardware acceleration.
  - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data or generated artifacts.
  - Consider serverless functions for scalable and cost-effective artifact generation.

### Security

- **Requirement:** Security is critical, especially regarding user data and generated intellectual property.
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Implement robust authentication and authorization using Supabase Auth.
  - Encrypt sensitive user data at rest and in transit.
  - Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - Implement rate limiting and other protective measures against denial-of-service attacks.
  - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
  - Secure API endpoints with appropriate access controls.

### Scalability

- **Requirement:** The platform should be scalable to handle a growing number of users and generated artifacts.
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Leverage the scalability features of Supabase (Postgres).
  - Design the backend API using a scalable framework like FastAPI.
  - Utilize serverless functions or containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for stateless components like artifact generation.
  - Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
  - Design the database schema for efficient scaling.

### Data Privacy

- **Requirement:** Data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations are essential.
- **Architectural Considerations:**
  - Store user data securely in the Supabase database with appropriate access controls.
  - Implement data retention policies and procedures for data deletion upon user request.
  - Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) through appropriate data handling practices and user consent mechanisms.
  - Anonymize or pseudonymize data where possible for analytics or logging purposes.

## Key Insights from Planning Documents

Based on `project_journal/planning/project_plan.md`, `project_journal/planning/requirements.md`, and `project_journal/planning/nfr_considerations.md`, the core non-functional requirements to address are:

- **Performance:** Minimize latency in agent responses and artifact generation, optimize web search, implement caching, and monitor performance.
- **Security:** Secure authentication/authorization, protect user data and IP, use HTTPS, validate input, update dependencies, and monitor security events.
- **Scalability:** Design for horizontal scaling, ensure database scalability, scale agent/artifact generation, and manage state in distributed environment.
- **Data Privacy:** Comply with regulations (GDPR, CCPA), obtain consent, minimize data collection, provide data control (access, modification, deletion), anonymize/pseudonymize, and secure storage/disposal.

Initial technical approaches are outlined, including technology choices like Next.js, FastAPI, Google ADK, and Supabase, and strategies like asynchronous operations, caching, encryption, RBAC, cloud infrastructure, load balancing, and message queues.

## Architectural Considerations for NFRs

Detailed architectural considerations addressing Performance, Security, Scalability, and Data Privacy have been documented in `project_journal/planning/architecture.md`. This includes technical approaches leveraging Next.js, FastAPI, Google ADK, and Supabase, along with strategies for asynchronous operations, caching, encryption, RBAC, cloud infrastructure, load balancing, and message queues.

## Architectural Decision Record

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) summarizing the initial architectural choices for addressing the non-functional requirements has been created: `project_journal/decisions/20250505-nfr-architecture.md`.

## Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

**Performance Risks:**

- Latency in AI model responses could impact user experience.
- Complex artifact generation might consume significant resources.
- Database performance bottlenecks under heavy load.

**Performance Mitigations:**

- Implement response streaming from AI models where possible.
- Utilize background processing and queuing for artifact generation.
- Optimize database schema and queries, consider read replicas or connection pooling.
- Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and profiling.

**Security Risks:**

- Data breaches exposing sensitive user information or generated IP.
- Injection attacks or other common web vulnerabilities.
- Compromised dependencies.

**Security Mitigations:**

- Enforce strong authentication and authorization controls.
- Regularly audit and penetration test the application.
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
- Use automated tools for dependency vulnerability scanning and keep dependencies updated.
- Implement security logging and alerting.

**Scalability Risks:**

- Difficulty scaling specific components (e.g., the conversational agent processing).
- Database becoming a bottleneck as data grows.
- Managing state in a distributed system.

**Scalability Mitigations:**

- Design components to be stateless where possible.
- Leverage managed cloud services that handle scaling automatically.
- Plan for database vertical and horizontal scaling strategies.
- Use message queues or event streams for inter-service communication.

**Data Privacy Risks:**

- Non-compliance with data privacy regulations.
- Unauthorized access to or misuse of user data.
- Failure to handle user data control requests (access, deletion).

**Data Privacy Mitigations:**

- Conduct legal review to ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
- Implement clear data governance policies and procedures.
- Build robust features for user data management (access, export, deletion).
- Provide training to the development team on data privacy best practices.
