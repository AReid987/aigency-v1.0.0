# ADR: Initial Architecture for Non-Functional Requirements

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
This decision record outlines the initial architectural choices made to address the key non-functional requirements (Performance, Security, Scalability, and Data Privacy) for the uXPRT application, as defined in `project_journal/planning/requirements.md` and elaborated in `project_journal/planning/nfr_considerations.md`. These NFRs are critical for the success and reliability of the platform.

**Decision:**
The initial architecture will incorporate the following key technical approaches to address the non-functional requirements:

- **Performance:** Utilize FastAPI for the backend, implement asynchronous operations for artifact generation, employ caching strategies, optimize database queries, and leverage Next.js for frontend performance.
- **Security:** Implement Supabase Auth for authentication/authorization, encrypt data at rest and in transit, validate inputs, manage dependencies, and monitor security events.
- **Scalability:** Deploy on a cloud platform with auto-scaling, use load balancing, leverage Supabase's scalable database, design modular components, and implement message queues.
- **Data Privacy:** Design for compliance with regulations (GDPR, CCPA), manage user consent, practice data minimization, provide user data controls, and ensure secure storage/disposal.

**Rationale:**
These technical approaches align with the project's chosen technology stack (Next.js, Python/FastAPI, Google ADK, Supabase) and provide a solid foundation for meeting the specified NFRs. FastAPI and Next.js offer performance benefits. Supabase provides built-in features for authentication, database scalability, and security. Cloud deployment enables horizontal scaling and load balancing. Asynchronous processing and message queues handle potential bottlenecks in artifact generation and traffic spikes. Data privacy considerations are integrated into the design to ensure compliance and user trust.

**Consequences:**

- Requires careful implementation of the chosen technical approaches.
- Ongoing monitoring and optimization will be necessary to ensure NFRs are consistently met as the application evolves.
- Potential need for more advanced solutions (e.g., database sharding, dedicated caching layer) as user load and data volume significantly increase.
- Requires adherence to secure coding practices and regular security reviews.
