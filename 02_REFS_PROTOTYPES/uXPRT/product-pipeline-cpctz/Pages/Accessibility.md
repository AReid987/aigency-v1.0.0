# Accessibility

## Accessibility Compliance Checklist

### Design Review

This section ensures all design elements—from color contrast to font size—are considered and optimized to provide a seamless experience for all users, including those with visual impairments.

### Color Contrast

Assess and verify the contrast ratios between text and background colors. Adhere to a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text to guarantee readability for users, including those with color vision deficiencies.

### Font Size

Standardize a minimum font size of 14 points (18.66 pixels) while maintaining design integrity. Larger font sizes are crucial for users with low vision and help improve the general readability of the content.

### Element Spacing

Refine the whitespace around clickable elements to minimize the risk of misclicks and enhance navigation. Ensure sufficient spacing to accommodate users who may use assistive technologies or have motor impairments.

### Text Alignment

Ensure that text alignment and orientation support readability. Left-align body text as it is easier for users with dyslexia and other reading difficulties.

### Responsive Design

Test design elements on different screen sizes and orientations. Ensure that your product remains functional and accessible whether viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

### Content Readability

This section ensures that your content is clear, concise, and structured for accessibility. This includes using descriptive alt text for images and adopting straightforward language.

### Alt Text

Provide informative and concise alt text for all images. The descriptions should convey the content and purpose of images, enhancing the browsing experience for users who are visually impaired.

### Understandable Language

Craft content using simple and plain language to ensure clarity. Avoid jargon and complex terms to make your content accessible to a broader audience.

### Headings and Structure

Use a logical hierarchy of headings (H1, H2, H3) to organize content. Structured content improves navigation through assistive technologies.

### Link Description

Ensure that all links have descriptive text that clearly indicates their destination or the action they initiate. This helps users understand the purpose of the links.

### Readability Tools

Utilize readability assessment tools to measure the complexity of your text. Aim for a reading level that accommodates a broad audience, typically around the 8th-grade level.

### Navigation

This section focuses on clear and consistent navigation patterns, ensuring that users, including those with mobility impairments, can move through your product efficiently using keyboards or other assistive devices.

### Tabbing Order

Ensure a logical and sequential tabbing order for all interactive elements. An intuitive tabbing flow enhances navigation, especially for users who rely on keyboard navigation.

### Keyboard Compatibility

Verify that all functionalities are accessible via keyboard commands. Ensure users can complete all tasks without needing a mouse.

### Skip Navigation Links

Implement skip navigation links to allow users to bypass repetitive content. This is particularly useful for keyboard and screen reader users.

### Focus Indicators

Provide visible focus indicators for all interactive elements. This helps users track their position on the screen, enhancing navigation for those relying on keyboards.

### Consistent Menus

Design menus that are consistent across all pages. Predictable navigation patterns reduce the learning curve and improve usability for all users.
