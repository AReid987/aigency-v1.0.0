# One Pager

## Description

What is the product? This is just a brief description of what you’re thinking, so that folks reading this doc can quickly grok what this project is all about. Keep it brief.

### Problem

Think of the problem like a hypothesis. What do you believe the problem you are solving is, and why? You’ll add more context later. Key attributes of a strong problem statement include: It’s short. Aim for a single sentence to describe the actual problem. The more you need to explain it, the less clear the problem ends up being. It’s focused. It includes just a single clear problem that can be owned by a single team and solved in a reasonable amount of time. It’s often very helpful to add some examples of what problem you are *not* solving. It references a “need” that is not being fulfilled. Try to focus this around a user need, but can also be a business need if necessary. The Jobs-To-Be-Done framework is especially useful here. It includes a what and a why. What’s going wrong, and why is it a problem? You’ll need to back this up in the next section. It’s agnostic of a solution. Resist the urge to jump to a solution this early. Examples of good problem statements: Lyft drivers are cancelling rides too often because the passengers are too far away. Airbnb hosts are feeling frustrated because they want to improve, but are finding it difficult to figure out how. Users are dropping off at too high a rate at the final step of the signup flow. Examples of bad problem statements: User growth is slowing. [Issue: Too broad for this process, see advice on approaching big picture strategy here and here. Also not user-centric.] Build a loyalty program. [Issue: Assumes a solution. What’s the problem this is solving?] Users are bouncing from the signup flow. [Issue: Not focused enough, and missing a hypothesis of the why. Go one level deeper.]

### Why

How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving? Back up your problem statement, aka hypothesis. What initially convinced you that this was a problem? What makes it clear to you that this problem needs to be tackled? Look at both quantitative and qualitative evidence. Collect all data points that point to this being a real and important problem. Quality over quantity. Three to five strong data points is far better than a dozen tangentially related points. Your case ends up being weaker with too many items because often you end up filling it with minor and unrelated data points to make it look like a lot of evidence. Your case doesn’t have to be perfect or air-tight. Play devil’s advocate with yourself. Try to convince yourself that this isn’t actually a real or big enough problem. What gaps do you have in your evidence? Is the evidence truly telling you what you think? Push yourself here.

### Success

How do we know if we’ve solved this problem? Ideally this is a specific metric, with a defined goal, that you can easily measure. Ideally it directly connects to your team’s KPI’s. Ideally it is based on hard data about the opportunity size, investment size, and a heuristic from past experiments. Rarely is it ever ideal. Here is some advice for defining your success criteria: Try hard to make it a concrete number, e.g., 10% increase in X, 50% decrease in Y, 20% adoption of feature Z within 3 months. Pick a goal that’s believable, but ambitious. What’s a goal that if you were to hit, your team and your leaders would be excited about? If you don’t think a metric makes sense for your goal (think long and hard about this), write out what concretely the world would look like if this was a big success. Make that the success criteria.

### Audience

Who are we building for? It should rarely be for all of your users. Is it for new or returning users? Is it for casual or power users? Is it for users on mobile or web? etc.

### What

Roughly, what does this look like in the product? This is where you take a shot at describing the solution to the problem. Depending on the way your team operates, and how much is already known, be as detailed as possible.

### How

How will we build or test this?

### When

When does it ship and what are the milestones?
