# Research Plan: Multi-Source Monitoring Dashboard APIs

## Objectives
- Investigate technical specifications for 10+ different APIs (data sources and publishing platforms)
- Provide comprehensive technical architecture recommendations for FastAPI + Next.js stack
- Document rate limiting, compliance, and implementation strategies
- Generate actionable code examples and integration patterns

## Key Questions
1. What are the authentication requirements, rate limits, and data structures for each API?
2. Which APIs offer the most reliable and feature-rich access for dashboard integration?
3. What are the optimal technical architecture patterns for this multi-API system?
4. How can we ensure compliance and efficient rate limit management across all platforms?

## Expected Deliverables
- Detailed API specification documents for each platform
- Technical architecture recommendations with code examples
- Rate limiting and compliance strategy guide
- Implementation roadmap with priority recommendations

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search-Focused (comprehensive information gathering across multiple platforms)
- Justification: Need to gather extensive technical documentation from multiple sources and synthesize into actionable recommendations
