# Progress Log: xprt-commit Infrastructure & Workflow Integration

## Date: 2025-04-11

### Summary

The following infrastructure and workflow improvements were completed for the `xprt-commit` package in the XPRT monorepo:

---

### 1. Turborepo Package Integration

- Added a `package.json` to `packages/xprt-commit`:
  - **Name:** `@xprt/xprt-commit`
  - **Version:** `0.1.0`
  - **Type:** `"module"`
  - **Scripts:** Added for linting, formatting, and CLI/dev server use.
  - **Exports/Main:** Configured for importability and correct monorepo dependency behavior.
- Ensured `@xprt/xprt-commit` is referenced in the root `turbo.json` workspace configuration.
- Package is now compatible with Turborepo dependency graph, cache, and parallelization.

---

### 2. Lint-Staged Setup

- Added `lint-staged.config.js` to run linters (eslint, prettier, etc.) only on staged files.
- Configured scripts and lint-staged tasks to maximize speed and efficiency for pre-commit linting and autofixing.
- All relevant linters now operate only on files staged for commit.

---

### 3. Lefthook Git Hooks

- Added/updated `lefthook.yml` in `packages/xprt-commit`:
  - **pre-commit:** Runs lint-staged and related checks.
  - **commit-msg:** (if needed) can run commit message linting.
- Ensured integration with Turborepo and monorepo-wide git hooks.
- Hooks are managed and cacheable as part of the Turborepo workflow.

---

### 4. Documentation & Comments

- All configuration files include clear comments explaining each section and its role in the workflow.
- The setup is documented for future maintainers and contributors.

---

### Next Steps

- Resume feature development and deeper integration:
  - Remaining linter wrappers (Prettier, Pylint, Biome.js, GPT Lint)
  - Lint orchestration and error display
  - Further Turborepo task graph and cache optimizations if required

---

**This log reflects the state as of 2025-04-11 and closes out the infrastructure milestone for xprt-commit.**
