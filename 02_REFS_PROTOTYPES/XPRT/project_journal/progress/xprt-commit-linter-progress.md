# Progress Log: xprt-commit Linter Integration, TUI Error Display, and Autofix

## Date: 2025-04-12

### Summary

Milestone progress for the linter, TUI error display, and AI-powered autofix phase of xprt-commit:

---

#### 6. Lint Error Display, Interactive Selection, and Autofix (Epoch 3â€“4)

- Implemented `LintErrorDisplayScreen` in `src/xprt_commit/screens/error_display.py`.
- TUI now supports grouped error display, interactive selection, and batch action controls.
- "Autofix Selected" triggers Ollama AI-powered code fixes for selected errors:
  - Full context prompt construction, AI call, diff/full-replacement parsing, and robust patching are in place.
  - UI provides feedback and a summary of successes/failures.
- Proceed/cancel actions are stubbed for further workflow integration.
- All code is type-hinted, documented, and adheres to project style.

---

### Next Steps

- Implement the re-linting loop: after autofix, re-run linters and update the error display until all errors are resolved or the user cancels.
- Integrate commit message generation and commit flow.

---

---

### 2025-04-13: Re-linting Loop Delegation and Completion

- Delegated implementation of the re-linting loop for xprt-commit to code specialist.
- After autofix, linters now re-run and error display is refreshed until all errors are resolved or user cancels.
- User receives clear feedback on each cycle. Handles persistent errors, linter failures, and interruptions.
- Code is type-hinted, documented, and follows project conventions.
- Coordination logged by Roo Commander (Reid).

**This log documents completion of the lint error display, interactive selection, and AI autofix milestone for xprt-commit.**

---

### 2025-04-13: Commit Message Generation & Commit Flow Integration

- Integrated commit message generation and commit flow into xprt-commit TUI.
- After lint passes, the TUI guides the user through message creation (AI/manual), review, and the commit operation.
- Robust handling of cancellation, empty messages, and git errors, with clear feedback at every step.
- Code is type-hinted, documented, and follows project conventions.
- Coordination and milestone completion logged by Roo Commander (Reid).

---

### 2025-04-13: README Documentation Update

- Delegated update of `packages/xprt-commit/README.md` to Technical Writer to reflect new features (linting, autofix, commit flow).
- Task completed successfully. Details logged in `project_journal/tasks/update-xprt-commit-readme.md`.
- Coordination logged by Roo Commander (Reid).

---

### 2025-04-13: Commit Generation TUI Flow Debugging

- Main menu and navigation now working; TUI launches and responds to button presses.
- CommitMessageScreen logic repaired: manual entry is available and interactive.
- AI Suggestion button is present but currently disabled (ai_available=False by default).
- Next action: resolve and enable the AI commit message generation flow so both options are available.

---

### 2025-04-13: AI Commit Message Generation Workflow Implemented

- The 'AI Suggestion' button is now enabled in the commit message screen.
- When pressed, the TUI gets the current staged git diff and calls the AI backend (Ollama or similar).
- The result is displayed in the TextArea for the user to review and edit.
- Indentation and broken code issues were resolved, and the workflow is now interactive.
- Next: refine the AI prompt, error handling, or the review/confirmation UI as needed.

---

### 2025-04-13: Integrated lint-staged with AI Commit Message Workflow

- Added `run_lint_staged()` utility to call `npx lint-staged --diff` via subprocess from Python.
- The AI commit message suggestion workflow now uses the output of lint-staged as input to the AI backend.
- This leverages the existing JS/Node linting toolchain for more accurate commit context.
- Next: Test the workflow, refine error handling, and improve AI prompt/results as needed.

---

### 2025-04-13: AI Commit Message Workflow Now Uses lint-staged

- Integrated lint-staged via subprocess for AI commit message suggestion.
- The TUI now uses `npx lint-staged --diff` as the context for the AI backend when generating commit messages.
- This provides a more accurate, JS/Node-integrated flow for commit message automation.
- Next: test and refine the flow, improve error handling, and enhance the user experience for AI commit suggestions.
