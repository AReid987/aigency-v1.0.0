# Handoff System Rules

## File Safety

- Never delete handoff documents without explicit confirmation
- Use versioning when making major changes to documents
- Keep handoff numbering sequential

## Structure Rules

- Place handoff documents directly in the handoffs/ root directory
- Place chat history files only in the 0-system/chat_history directory
- Use the 0-system directory only for system files, not handoffs

## Workflow Guidelines

- Run extraction scripts before attempting to read conversation files
- Verify files moved to milestone directories have been copied correctly
- Always document deviations from original plans

## Chat History Protocol

- NEVER attempt to read files from the chat_history directory
- ALWAYS use shell commands to check if files exist in this directory
- If files exist, IMMEDIATELY run the extraction script
- ONLY work with the extracted files after processing

## Security Enforcement

- Consider the chat_history directory as a RESTRICTED AREA
- Run the CHECK_CHAT_HISTORY function before any handoff creation
- Always validate paths before file operations
- Follow the mandatory protocols defined in the system prompt

## Additional Rules

- When a user requests additional rules, add them to the "Additional Rules" section of the `.clinerules` file in the project's root directory.
- Identify new rules by the prefix `RULE:` in user messages.
- For example, if the user writes `RULE: keep the README.md up to date`, append the rule as `- keep README.md up to date`.
- In contrary if a user writes `NORULE:` you remove the according line from the "Additional Rules" section.
- Persist these rules throughout the project lifecycle.
- Ensure that all added rules are clear, specific, and actionable.
- Format each rule as a separate bullet point.
