#### **2. üìù Abstract**

**Overview:**

XPRT is an AI-driven platform that streamlines product development by generating comprehensive documentation (PRDs, design systems, user stories) and enabling collaborative workflows. The platform combines conversational AI, no-code tools, and integrated design systems to unify product planning, branding, and execution.

**Key Features:**

- **AI-Driven Documentation**: Generate PRDs, FRDs, and brand books via conversational interfaces.

- **Atomic Design Systems**: Create brand identities, design tokens, and style guides through AI collaboration.

- **Notion-Style Editor**: Collaborative markdown-based notes, backlinks, and real-time editing.

- **TLDraw Integration**: Visual sketching, wireframing, and diagramming.

- **No-Code & Chat Tools**: Self-hosted workflows (n8n, Flowise AI) and OpenWebUI integration.

**Rationale:**

XPRT addresses fragmented product development workflows by centralizing documentation, design, and collaboration into a single AI-augmented platform.
