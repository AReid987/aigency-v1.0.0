## SUMMARY
The video presents a designer discussing functional color mapping, a strategic approach to assigning colors based on roles and functions in design rather than aesthetics alone.

## IDEAS:
- Traditional color selection often relies on emotion or taste.
- Functional color mapping assigns colors specific roles and functions.
- Action colors are used for buttons, CTAs, or emphasis in design.
- Support colors balance layouts or connect sections visually.
- Neutral colors provide breathing room in the design.
- Feedback colors indicate success, warning, or error.
- Anchor colors serve as the base or stabilizing element.
- A color map matrix helps assess color performance across platforms.
- The matrix is a 3x4 grid for digital, print, and social media.
- Digital designs use vibrant colors for CTAs and muted for support.
- Print designs may need color adjustments for visibility.
- Social media designs must ensure colors stand out.
- Define color roles as the first step in the system.
- Use the color map matrix to assess performance across platforms.
- Apply the system to the actual layout as the next step.
- Test designs for contrast, color blindness, and scalability.
- The system creates a scalable visual language across platforms.
- Functional color mapping ensures designs are effective, not just decorative.
- Think of color as a system, not just a scheme.
- Try functional color mapping to build design confidence.
- A strategic approach to color aids in scalability and professionalism.
- KD is mentioned as a browser-based design platform.
- The platform integrates various design tools in one place.
- The video encourages exploring more graphic design skills.
- Watching other videos on the channel is recommended for learning.

## INSIGHTS:
- Functional color mapping adds strategy to color selection.
- Colors should have specific roles: action, support, neutral, feedback, anchor.
- A color map matrix helps in assessing color performance.
- The system ensures designs are functional and effective.
- Think of color as a system for scalability and professionalism.
- KD integrates various design tools in one place.
- Exploring more graphic design skills is encouraged.
- Watching other videos on the channel aids learning.
- Functional color mapping builds confidence in design choices.
- The system creates a scalable visual language across platforms.

## QUOTES:
- "Most designers choose colors based on taste or emotion, which can be effective but lacks a strategic approach."
- "Instead of assigning colors based on appearance, assign them based on their roles and functions within the design."
- "Each color should have a specific job: action takers, background players, communicators, and anchors."
- "A 3x4 grid to map colors across different platforms (digital, print, social media) and roles (action taker, communicator, anchor, neutral)."
- "Helps in assessing the performance of each color across different outputs before committing to a final design."
- "Vibrant coral orange for CTAs, deep navy for headings, muted teal for support, soft off-white for breathing room, midtone gray for anchoring."
- "Adjustments might be needed, such as increasing the red channel for the orange color."
- "Ensuring colors perform well in the competitive niche."
- "Define roles for each color."
- "Use the color map matrix to assess performance across platforms."
- "Apply the system to the actual layout."
- "Test the design for contrast, color blindness, and scalability across different devices and media."
- "Creates a visual language that can scale across various platforms (motion, merchandise, UI, posters, packaging)."
- "Ensures the design is functional and effective, not just decorative."
- "Encourages designers to think of color as a system rather than a scheme."
- "Suggests trying this method on the next project to build confidence in design choices."
- "Emphasizes the importance of a strategic approach to color in design for scalability and professionalism."
- "KD, a browser-based design platform that simplifies workflow by integrating various design tools in one place."
- "Try the functional color mapping method on your next project."
- "Explore more graphic design skills and aspects by watching other videos on the channel."
