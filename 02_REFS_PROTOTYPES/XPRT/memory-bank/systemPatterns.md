# System Patterns & Best Practices

A living document of architectural patterns, design approaches, and best practices emerging during development.

---

## Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Use **modular agent components** communicating via MCP servers.
- Support **agent chaining and delegation** for complex tasks.
- Implement **agent observability**: logging, evaluation, feedback loops.
- Enable **autonomous ingestion** with fallback to manual triggers.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Combine **LightRAG** and **VideoRAG** for multimodal retrieval.
- Use **knowledge graph traversal** to enhance retrieval accuracy.
- Cache results and update embeddings asynchronously.

## Knowledge Graph Design
- Use a **graph database** optimized for traversal and visualization.
- Include rich metadata on nodes (type, source, version).
- Support **versioning and branching** of knowledge artifacts.
- Visualize traversal paths in 3D for transparency.

## Conversational UI
- Support **turn-based interactions** with branching/splitting.
- Visualize conversations via **xyFlow**.
- Allow navigation across conversation history.
- Enable agent-initiated suggestions during chats.

## Collaboration & Project Management
- Generate documentation via **agent Q&A sessions**.
- Automatically create **Kanban boards** linked to generated specs.
- Score tasks by complexity and track progress visually.
- Link project artifacts in the knowledge graph.

## Development Practices
- Prioritize **modularity and reusability**.
- Maintain **clear separation** between ingestion, retrieval, orchestration, and UI.
- Use **open-source tools** to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Document all deviations and discoveries in handoffs.

## Future Patterns
- Integrate **voice agents** post-MVP.
- Support **multimodal input/output**.
- Explore **self-improving agent behaviors** via reinforcement learning.
