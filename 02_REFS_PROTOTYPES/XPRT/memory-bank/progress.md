# Progress Log

A chronological record of project milestones, achievements, blockers, and lessons learned.

---

## 2025-04-04

- Initialized project directory and memory bank structure.
- Drafted comprehensive **Project Brief**.
- Created initial **handoff** and **system instructions**.
- Defined product vision, technical stack, and immediate priorities.

## 2025-04-05 _(Current)_

- Created detailed **Product Context**, **Technical Context**, and **Active Context** documents.
- Updated progress
- Outlined initial sprint goals and MVP focus.
- Identified key blockers: agent orchestration choice, graph DB selection, CI/CD setup.
- Planning integration of MCP servers (LightRAG, VideoRAG, Crawl4AI).
- Preparing collaboration and documentation workflows.

---

## Next Steps

- Prototype core multi-agent orchestration.
- Develop initial knowledge graph ingestion and visualization.
- Implement MVP conversational UI.
- Set up basic CI/CD pipeline.
- Continue documenting discoveries and pivots.

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of clear stepwise documentation.
- Need for modular, iterative MVP delivery.
- Early identification of integration challenges helps scope planning.

## Blockers & Risks

- Finalizing technology choices.
- Integration complexity.
- Managing feature creep.

Update this log **at the end of each sprint** and upon major breakthroughs or challenges.

## 2025-04-22

- **Debugged `xprt-commit` AI Worker:** Investigated and resolved issues preventing the `generate_ai_commit_message_worker` thread from starting and logging in `commit_message_screen.py`.
  - **Fix 1:** Refactored worker invocation to use Textual's message passing (`post_message` + handler) instead of direct `run_worker` call from `on_button_pressed`.
  - **Fix 2:** Switched from `self.app.log` to standard Python `logging` within the worker thread for reliable logging.
  - **Fix 3:** Added missing `import subprocess` in `git_utils.py`.
  - **Fix 4:** Corrected error handling in `run_lint_staged` (`git_utils.py`) to check return code and return `None` on failure.
- **Result:** AI worker now starts, logs correctly, handles `lint-staged` failures gracefully, and updates UI appropriately.

## 2025-04-22 (Continued)

- **Completed Task XPRTC-002:** Integrated linting/fixing (`lint-staged`) before AI commit message generation.
  - Modified `main.py` to run `lint-staged` after potential staging.
  - Added error handling for `lint-staged` failures.
  - Fetched final staged diff using `get_staged_diff` after successful linting.
  - Updated `CommitMessageScreen` and its worker to accept and use the final diff content.
  - Created `build_commit_message_prompt` and `call_ollama_commit_message` in `ai_utils.py` specifically for generating commit messages from diffs.
  - Ensured the AI worker uses the new diff-based commit message generation function.
- **Completed Task XPRTC-001:** Implemented unstaged file check and interactive staging screen (`StageFilesScreen`) before commit message generation.

- **Completed Task XPRTC-002:** Integrated linting (`lint-staged`) and AI commit message generation (`ollama`) using the "Lint/Fix First" sequence. The workflow now runs linters after staging, gets the final diff, and passes it to the AI worker. Error handling for lint failures is included.

[2025-04-22 08:56:54] - Completed Task XPRTC-001 (Revised): Refined `xprt-commit` pre-commit flow to check both staged/unstaged files, notify user of counts, conditionally show `StageFilesScreen`, and proceed to linting only if files are staged after interaction.

- **Completed Task XPRTC-001 (Revised):** Refined the pre-commit check and staging workflow. Unified triggers, added initial staged/unstaged counts, enhanced `StageFilesScreen` with dynamic updates and "Stage All" functionality, and ensured linting only proceeds if files are staged.

* 84 |
* 85 | ## 2025-04-28
* 86 |
* 87 | - **Completed Task XPRTC-003:** Implemented the fully automated commit workflow in `xprt-commit`.
* 88 | - Enhanced `StageFilesScreen` for interactive staging (building on XPRTC-001 Revised).
* 89 | - Modified `run_lint_staged` in `git_utils.py` to return detailed output.
* 90 | - Enhanced `LintErrorDisplayScreen` to display linter output, support autofix re-runs via a worker, and handle proceeding/canceling.
* 91 | - Modified `CommitMessageScreen` to include a "Commit" button and post a message upon confirmation.
* 92 | - Updated `main.py` to orchestrate the flow: check files -> staging screen (if needed) -> linting screen -> commit message screen -> final commit execution.
* 93 | - Integrated error handling and transitions between screens for the full workflow.
