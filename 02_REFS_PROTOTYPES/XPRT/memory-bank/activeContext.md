# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Finalize initial documentation and project scaffolding.
- Evaluate and select core agent frameworks (Langflow, alternatives).
- Develop MVP features:
  - Multi-agent orchestration
  - Initial knowledge graph setup
  - Conversational UI with agent-driven retrieval
  - Autonomous ingestion pipelines

## Sprint Goals
- Set up monorepo with Turborepo, pnpm, pdm, uv.
- Containerize backend services with Docker and Dev Containers.
- Establish basic frontend with Next.js, Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI.
- Prototype knowledge graph ingestion and visualization.
- Implement initial agent chat interface with retrieval capabilities.

## Immediate Priorities
- Define data schemas for knowledge graph and project artifacts.
- Integrate LightRAG and Crawl4AI MCP servers.
- Prepare agent evaluation criteria.
- Draft initial collaboration workflows.

## Blockers
- Finalizing agent orchestration framework choice.
- Selecting graph database technology.
- Integration challenges between multi-agent system and UI.
- Lack of CI/CD pipeline (to be addressed after MVP foundation).

## Risks
- Scope creep due to ambitious feature set.
- Integration complexity across multiple AI modules.
- Cost management to ensure free development phase.

## Notes
- Focus on **iterative delivery**: get MVP working, then expand.
- Document all discoveries and pivots in handoffs.
- Maintain modular codebase for future voice/multimodal integrations.
