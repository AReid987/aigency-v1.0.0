# FormWhisperer Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal, Objective and Context

FormWhisperer's primary goal is to eliminate the manual burden of completing diverse online forms, beginning with market research surveys. It aims to provide an autonomous, intelligent AI agent that can navigate web interfaces, interact with various form elements, and generate human-like, personalized responses. This addresses the inefficiency and tedium associated with manual form filling, enabling users to scale data collection and simulate authentic user interactions. The core objective is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that showcases this autonomous, persona-driven form completion with a strong emphasis on realistic human behavior.

## Functional Requirements (MVP)

The MVP of FormWhisperer will focus on the core capabilities required for autonomous, human-like market research survey completion:

1. **Autonomous Browser Navigation & Interaction:** The system shall be able to launch and control a browser instance (headless or visible), navigate to specified URLs, handle login processes, identify and select survey links from a dashboard, and navigate within a survey.

2. **Varied Form Field Completion:** The agent shall be capable of accurately identifying and interacting with common HTML form elements including:

    - Text input fields (single-line and multi-line).

    - Dropdown (select) menus.

    - Checkboxes and radio buttons.

    - Slider controls.

    - Dynamic calendar or date pickers.

3. **Persona-Based Response Generation:** The AI agent shall generate responses for open-ended questions and select appropriate options for demographic questions (e.g., income, race, age, gender, opinions on sensitive topics like abortion legality) based on a pre-defined or learned persona.

4. **Realistic Human Behavior Emulation:** The browser interaction shall simulate human-like behavior, including:

    - Variable navigation paths (e.g., sometimes directly accessing a survey URL, other times navigating through a survey dashboard with varied filtering options like "most points," "shortest time," or random selection).

    - Typing at a slightly above average Words Per Minute (WPM) rate with realistic pauses.

    - Variable click speeds and scroll patterns.

    - Occasional, randomized idle times or "breaks" during survey completion.

    - Variability in the exact sequence of filling out non-dependent fields.

5. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Mechanism:** The system shall implement a clear mechanism (e.g., integration with Telegram or direct text messages) to prompt the user for clarification or input when the AI agent encounters an ambiguous question, an unrecognized form element, or has low confidence in a response. This mechanism should facilitate the AI's continuous learning.

6. **Basic Persona Initialization:** The system shall allow the user to provide initial persona data through a structured input method (e.g., a simple questionnaire/survey) to establish the AI's core profile.

## Non Functional Requirements (MVP)

1. **Performance:** The AI agent shall complete surveys at speeds consistent with a human user (e.g., not completing a 50-question survey in 30 seconds).

2. **Reliability:** The system shall gracefully handle common web errors (e.g., page load failures, network timeouts) and resume operations or alert the user via HITL.

3. **Security:** All persona data and user credentials shall be stored and handled securely, adhering to best practices for data encryption and access control. External API keys (if any) shall be managed securely.

4. **Maintainability:** The codebase shall be modular and well-documented to facilitate future enhancements and debugging.

5. **Scalability:** The architecture should allow for future expansion to handle multiple concurrent survey completions or multiple personas (though not part of MVP).

6. **Usability (for HITL):** The HITL interface shall be simple and intuitive, allowing the user to provide quick, clear input to the AI agent.

## User Interaction and Design Goals

FormWhisperer's user interface (if any, initially for setup and HITL) should be clean, functional, and intuitive. The primary experience will be the autonomous operation of the AI agent within a browser, so the "design" extends to the realism of this interaction.

- **Overall Vision & Experience:** The desired experience for users is one of effortlessness and trust. Users should feel confident that FormWhisperer is accurately representing their persona while handling tedious tasks.

- **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The core interaction for the user will be minimal direct interaction, primarily setup and responding to HITL queries. The AI's interaction with forms is the main "UI."

- **Core Screens/Views (Conceptual):**

    - Agent Status Dashboard (conceptual, for monitoring progress, not necessarily a full UI in MVP).

    - Persona Setup/Management Interface (initial simple questionnaire).

    - HITL Notification/Response Interface (e.g., within Telegram or a simple text chat).

- **Accessibility Aspirations:** The core browser automation should attempt to interact with web elements in an accessibility-conscious manner where possible (e.g., respecting ARIA attributes, tab order).

- **Target Devices/Platforms:** Primarily web-based for the automated agent, with mobile-friendly interfaces for HITL interactions (e.g., via messaging apps).

## Technical Assumptions

- **Repository & Service Architecture:** For FormWhisperer, a **Monorepo** structure is envisioned. This will host separate, distinct backend services for the core AI agent logic (browser automation, persona modeling, HITL orchestration) and potentially a lightweight frontend for initial setup/management and HITL interaction. This approach offers benefits in shared tooling, code reuse, and streamlined deployment for related services, while allowing for clear separation of concerns between different functional modules.

    - **Rationale:** Given the distinct but interconnected components (browser automation, AI, persona management, HITL), a monorepo facilitates versioning and shared libraries. Microservices within the monorepo will allow for independent scaling and development of specialized functionalities.

- **Preferred Browser Automation Frameworks:** The core automation will leverage robust and performant frameworks such as 'Browser Use' and 'Browser MCP' for controlling browser instances and interacting with web UIs.

- **AI Persona Modeling:** Initial persona modeling will rely on user-provided data. Future enhancements may explore techniques similar to Eliza OS, potentially involving scraping public social media profiles (e.g., Twitter) with explicit user consent and robust privacy safeguards.

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Integration:** HITL communication will be facilitated through popular, accessible messaging platforms like Telegram or generic text messaging services, chosen for their real-time notification capabilities.

- **Language Models:** State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) will be used for natural language understanding and generation, particularly for open-ended questions and maintaining persona consistency.

- **NoSQL Database:** A flexible NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB) will be considered for storing diverse persona profiles, survey progress, and learned interaction patterns due to its schema flexibility.

### Testing requirements

For FormWhisperer, validation beyond unit testing will be crucial due to the dynamic nature of web interactions and persona simulation.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Critical user journeys (e.g., login, selecting a survey, completing various question types, handling HITL prompts) shall be covered by automated E2E tests using the chosen browser automation frameworks. These tests will simulate realistic user interactions and verify successful form completion and persona consistency.

- **Integration Testing:** Components interacting with external services (e.g., survey platforms APIs, HITL messaging services) or internal modules (e.g., persona engine, form parser) shall have integration tests.

- **Manual Testing/Observational Testing:** Given the "human-like behavior" requirement, a degree of manual and observational testing will be necessary to visually confirm the realism of browser interactions (e.g., variable speeds, scrolling patterns).

- **Regression Testing:** A robust suite of automated tests will ensure that new features or bug fixes do not negatively impact existing form completion capabilities.

- **Monorepo/Polyrepo:** This is a **Monorepo**.

- **Key Modules/Components and Responsibilities:**

    - `services/`: Handles API exposure, user management (if any UI), and orchestration of various agent components.

    - `agents/`: Contains the core AI logic, including browser automation, form parsing, persona-based response generation, and the learning engine. This will be the "brain" of FormWhisperer.

    - `shared/`: Common code and type definitions used across TypeScript and Python modules.

    - `web-ui/`: A lightweight frontend for initial persona setup and monitoring (MVP optional, might just be CLI/HITL in early MVP).

- **Data Flow Overview (Conceptual):** User defines persona -> Persona data stored -> Agent selects survey URL -> Browser Automator navigates -> Form Parser identifies elements -> Response Generator consults persona & LLM -> Agent fills form -> If low confidence, HITL Orchestrator prompts user -> User responds -> Agent incorporates input & learns.
