# Story 2.2: Identify and Select Dropdowns, Checkboxes, and Radio Buttons

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a FormWhisperer agent

- I want to identify and select options from dropdown menus, checkboxes, and radio buttons

- so that I can answer multiple-choice and selection-based questions.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- The agent can detect dropdown (select) elements and select an option by text or value.

- The agent can detect and click checkboxes to select/deselect them.

- The agent can detect and click radio buttons to select an option within a group.

- The agent randomly varies the click speed for these elements.

- The system logs successful selection/clicking of these elements.

- Local command-line test script can verify selection on a test page.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Enhance Form Parsing for Selection Fields (AC: 1, 2, 3)**

    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Within the `form-parser` agent (`src/agents/form-parser/`), enhance identification logic to accurately detect HTML `<select>`, `<input type="checkbox">`, and `<input type="radio">` elements.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: For `<select>` elements, ensure the parser can extract all `<option>` values and visible texts.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: For checkboxes and radio buttons, ensure the parser can identify their `value`, `name` (for grouping radio buttons), and current `checked` state.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Define structured data representations for identified dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio button groups.

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Selection Field Interaction in Browser Automator (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)**

    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Within the `browser-automator` agent (`src/agents/browser-automator/`), develop functions to interact with:

        - Dropdowns: Select an option using its value or visible text.

        - Checkboxes: Click to toggle their state (select/deselect).

        - Radio Buttons: Click to select a specific option within a named group.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Use `Browser Use` or `Browser MCP` for these interactions.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement logic to ensure a *single* option is selected for radio button groups.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Introduce a mechanism for randomly varying the click speed for all selection elements (e.g., between 100ms and 500ms beyond base automation speed) to simulate human behavior.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.5: Incorporate logging for each selection field interaction, including the field identified and the selected value/state, as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#logging`.

- [ ] **Task 3: Orchestrate Selection Field Completion (AC: 1, 2, 3)**

    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Update the `automation-orchestrator` service (`src/services/automation-orchestrator/`) to integrate the enhanced `form-parser` and `browser-automator` for selection field completion.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: When parsing a page, orchestrator identifies selection fields via `form-parser`.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: For each identified selection field, orchestrator requests an appropriate answer (from `response-generator`, future story) and then commands `browser-automator` to interact with it.

- [ ] **Task 4: Develop Local Test Script for Selection Fields (AC: 6)**

    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Create a simple, local HTML file with examples of dropdowns, multiple checkboxes, and radio button groups.

    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Develop a Python CLI script (in `scripts/`) that uses the `browser-automator` to launch a browser, navigate to this test page, and attempt to interact with all selection fields.

    - [ ] Subtask 4.3: The script should verify that the correct options are selected/clicked and that logging records these actions.

- [ ] **Task 5: Implement Logging (AC: 5)**

    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Ensure `browser-automator` logs successful detection and interaction with dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons, adhering to the structured logging standards.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story extends the `Form Parser` and `Browser Automator` capabilities to handle common selection-based UI elements.

- **Browser Automation Frameworks:** Continue utilizing `Browser Use` and `Browser MCP` for precise interaction with HTML elements, including `select` elements, and clicking `input[type='checkbox']` and `input[type='radio']` elements.

- **Project Structure:** Ensure new code within `form-parser` and `browser-automator` adheres to `src/agents/` structure. Updates to `automation-orchestrator` in `src/services/automation-orchestrator/`.

- **Form Parsing Detail:** The `form-parser` needs to distinguish between single-choice (radio, dropdown) and multi-choice (checkbox) inputs, extracting all available options and their values.

- **Human-like Behavior (Click Speed):** The AC's emphasis on *randomly varying click speed* is key. Implement this variability in the `browser-automator`'s click actions for these element types. This is a critical non-functional requirement.

- **Logging:** Continue with structured JSON logging (`structlog` for Python agents, `Pino` for Node.js services). Ensure logs capture details of selections made.

- **Coding Standards & Testing:** Adhere strictly to Python and TypeScript coding standards and type safety.

    - Unit tests for `form-parser`: Verify accurate identification of various dropdown, checkbox, and radio button HTML structures and their options.

    - Unit tests for `browser-automator`: Test selection logic for each type, including click speed variability and correct radio button group behavior (only one selected).

    - Integration tests: Verify the `automation-orchestrator` can correctly parse a test page with these elements and successfully command the `browser-automator` to make selections.
