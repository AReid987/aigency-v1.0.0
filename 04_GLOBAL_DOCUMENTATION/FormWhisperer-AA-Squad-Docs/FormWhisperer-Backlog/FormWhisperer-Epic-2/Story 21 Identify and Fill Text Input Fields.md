# Story 2.1: Identify and Fill Text Input Fields

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a FormWhisperer agent

- I want to identify and fill out text input fields

- so that I can provide textual answers to survey questions.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- The agent can detect single-line and multi-line text input fields.

- The agent can type alphanumeric characters into detected text fields.

- The agent's typing speed varies realistically (e.g., between 50-70 WPM).

- The agent can clear existing text from a field before typing.

- The system logs successful text field completion.

- Local command-line test script can verify text field completion on a test page.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Integrate Form Parsing for Text Fields (AC: 1)**

    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Enhance the `form-parser` agent (`src/agents/form-parser/`) to accurately identify HTML `<input type="text">`, `<textarea>`, and other relevant text-based input fields.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Ensure the parser can extract attributes like `id`, `name`, `placeholder`, `value`, and whether it's a single-line or multi-line field.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Define a structured data representation for identified text fields (e.g., JSON object including selector, current value, max length).

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Text Field Interaction in Browser Automator (AC: 2, 3, 4)**

    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Within the `browser-automator` agent (`src/agents/browser-automator/`), develop a function to receive a text field's structured data (from Task 1) and a generated answer.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Use `Browser Use` or `Browser MCP` to locate the identified text field in the active browser instance.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement logic to clear the existing content of the text field.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Implement a typing simulation that types the provided answer into the field character by character.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.5: Introduce realistic, variable typing speeds (e.g., slightly above average WPM, as defined in PRD) and small, randomized pauses between characters or words.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.6: Incorporate logging for each text field interaction, including the field identified and the text entered, as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#logging`.

- [ ] **Task 3: Orchestrate Text Field Completion (AC: 1, 2)**

    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Update the `automation-orchestrator` service (`src/services/automation-orchestrator/`) to integrate the `form-parser` and `browser-automator` for text field completion.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: When a page is loaded, orchestrator calls `form-parser` to identify text fields.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: For each identified text field, orchestrator requests an answer (from `response-generator`, future story) and then commands `browser-automator` to fill it.

- [ ] **Task 4: Develop Local Test Script for Text Fields (AC: 6)**

    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Create a simple, local HTML file with various types of text input fields (single-line, multi-line, pre-filled).

    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Develop a Python CLI script (in `scripts/`) that uses the `browser-automator` to launch a browser, navigate to this test page, and attempt to fill all text fields.

    - [ ] Subtask 4.3: The script should log its actions and verify that text was successfully entered into the fields.

- [ ] **Task 5: Implement Logging (AC: 5)**

    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Ensure `browser-automator` logs successful text field detections, typing operations, and any failures, adhering to the structured logging standards.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is central to the `Browser Automator` and `Form Parser` agents' core functionality.

- **Browser Automation Frameworks:** This story will heavily rely on `Browser Use` and `Browser MCP` within the Python `browser-automator` agent. Ensure these are correctly integrated and utilized for browser control (launch, navigation, element interaction).

- **Project Structure:** New code for `form-parser` and `browser-automator` should reside in their respective `src/agents/` subdirectories. Updates to `automation-orchestrator` should be in `src/services/automation-orchestrator/`.

- **Form Parsing:** The `form-parser` needs to be robust in identifying various text field types, as specified in `docs/front-end-component-guide.md` (implicitly, via standard HTML input types).

- **Human-like Behavior:** Pay careful attention to implementing the variable typing speeds and pauses within the `browser-automator` as specified in the ACs. This is a critical non-functional requirement.

- **Logging:** Use `structlog` for Python agents and `Pino` for Node.js services for structured JSON logging. Include `correlationId` in all logs.

- **Coding Standards & Testing:** Adhere to Python and TypeScript coding standards (including type hints/strict typing), naming conventions, and unit test file organization as defined in `docs/operational-guidelines.md`.

    - Unit tests for `form-parser`: Ensure accurate identification and structured output for various HTML text input field examples.

    - Unit tests for `browser-automator`: Test typing simulation, clearing fields, and variable speed logic.

    - Integration tests: Verify the `automation-orchestrator` can successfully parse a page and command the `browser-automator` to fill fields on a test page.
