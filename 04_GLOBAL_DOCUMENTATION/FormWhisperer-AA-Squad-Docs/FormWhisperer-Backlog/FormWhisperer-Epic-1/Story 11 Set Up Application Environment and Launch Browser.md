# Story 1.1: Set Up Application Environment and Launch Browser

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a FormWhisperer user

- I want to set up the application environment and launch a browser instance

- so that I can prepare for automated form completion.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- The application can be initialized and configured.

- A browser instance (Chrome or Chromium) can be launched and controlled.

- The browser can navigate to a specified URL.

- The browser can successfully log into a dummy survey platform (for testing).

- The system logs successful browser launch and navigation.

- CLI commands are available to initiate browser launch and navigate to a URL.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Initialize Monorepo Project Structure (AC: 1)**

    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create the base monorepo directory `FormWhisperer/`.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Set up `package.json` for npm/yarn workspaces to manage multiple packages within `src/`.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Create initial essential directories: `docs/`, `scripts/`, `src/services/`, `src/agents/`, `src/shared/`, `test/`.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Add `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts, `node_modules/`, `venv/`, and environment files (`.env`).

    - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Create base `README.md` for project overview and setup instructions.

- [ ] **Task 2: Configure Core Backend Service Environment (AC: 1)**

    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Initialize a Node.js/TypeScript project for the `automation-orchestrator` service within `src/services/automation-orchestrator/`.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Set up `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation according to defined coding standards (strict mode).

    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Configure `ESLint` and `Prettier` for TypeScript services according to coding standards.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Implement a basic configuration module to load environment variables securely (e.g., from `.env.example` file).

- [ ] **Task 3: Configure Core Python Agent Environment (AC: 1)**

    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Initialize a Python project (e.g., with Poetry or Pipenv) for the `browser-automator` agent within `src/agents/browser-automator/`.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Configure `pyproject.toml` for Black, Flake8, and MyPy according to coding standards.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Implement a basic Python configuration loading mechanism for environment variables.

- [ ] **Task 4: Implement Browser Launch Functionality (AC: 2, 3)**

    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Install `Browser Use` and `Browser MCP` libraries in the `browser-automator` Python agent.

    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Develop a Python function within `src/agents/browser-automator/` to launch a Chrome/Chromium browser instance using `Browser Use`.

    - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Extend the function to navigate to a specified URL.

    - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Implement basic error handling for browser launch and navigation failures.

- [ ] **Task 5: Implement Basic Login for Dummy Platform (AC: 4)**

    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Create a simple test web page (or use an existing one) that simulates a login form.

    - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Develop a Python function within `browser-automator` to interact with this dummy login form (e.g., fill username/password fields, click login button) using `Browser Use`.

- [ ] **Task 6: Implement Basic Logging (AC: 5)**

    - [ ] Subtask 6.1: Integrate structured logging (e.g., `Pino` for Node.js, `structlog` for Python) into the `automation-orchestrator` and `browser-automator`.

    - [ ] Subtask 6.2: Log successful browser launch, navigation, and dummy login attempts (INFO level).

    - [ ] Subtask 6.3: Log any errors (ERROR level) during these operations.

- [ ] **Task 7: Create CLI Commands (AC: 6)**

    - [ ] Subtask 7.1: Develop a Node.js CLI script (in `scripts/`) to trigger the `automation-orchestrator` to launch a browser and navigate to a URL.

    - [ ] Subtask 7.2: Ensure the CLI script can pass arguments (e.g., target URL).

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on establishing the foundational environment and browser control.

- **Project Structure:** Adhere strictly to the monorepo structure outlined in `docs/architecture.md#project-structure`. `automation-orchestrator` in `src/services/` and `browser-automator` in `src/agents/`.

- **Dependencies:** Ensure `Browser Use` and `Browser MCP` are correctly installed and imported in the Python `browser-automator` agent.

- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive data (e.g., dummy login credentials for testing) MUST be accessed via environment variables and NOT hardcoded. Refer to `docs/architecture.md#secrets-management` and `docs/environment-vars.md` (once sharded).

- **Coding Standards:** Follow TypeScript and Python coding standards, naming conventions, and type safety as defined in `docs/architecture.md#coding-standards`.

- **Unit Tests:** Create `*.test.ts` files co-located with TypeScript source files and `test_*.py` files in `test/unit/` mirroring the Python source structure. Unit tests should cover browser launch, navigation, and basic login attempts.

- **Logging:** Implement structured JSON logging using `Pino` (TypeScript) and `structlog` (Python) for all operations. Ensure `correlationId` is included in logs.

- **Dummy Login:** For AC 4, a very simple local HTML file simulating a login form will suffice initially, or an easily accessible public test site. No real credentials should be used.

- **Browser Installation:** Assume Chrome/Chromium is available in the execution environment or guide on its installation as part of local setup.
