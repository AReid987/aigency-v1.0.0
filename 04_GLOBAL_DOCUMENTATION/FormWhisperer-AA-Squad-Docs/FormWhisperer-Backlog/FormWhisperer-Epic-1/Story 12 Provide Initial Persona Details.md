# Story 1.2: Provide Initial Persona Details

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a FormWhisperer user

- I want to provide initial persona details

- so that the AI agent can begin to answer questions as me.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- A mechanism exists (e.g., initial questionnaire) for the user to input core persona attributes (e.g., basic demographics, general preferences).

- The persona data is securely stored.

- The AI agent can access this initial persona data for response generation.

- The system logs successful persona data storage.

- A CLI command is available to trigger persona data input process.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Design Persona Data Model (AC: 1)**

    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Confirm and, if necessary, refine the `Persona` TypeScript interface and its structure based on `docs/data-models.md`.

    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Define the validation rules for persona attributes (e.g., age range, gender enum, income range, opinion topics).

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Persona Service Backend (AC: 2, 3)**

    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create a new Node.js/TypeScript service: `src/services/persona-service/`.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement the `Persona Service API` endpoints for creating and retrieving personas (e.g., `POST /api/v1/personas`, `GET /api/v1/personas/{id}`) as defined in `docs/api-reference.md`.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Integrate with MongoDB to securely store and retrieve `Persona` documents according to the defined schema in `docs/data-models.md`.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Ensure all data is validated upon ingress as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#security-best-practices` (Input Sanitization/Validation).

    - [ ] Subtask 2.5: Implement basic authentication/authorization for internal service-to-service calls as per `docs/api-reference.md#persona-service-api`.

    - [ ] Subtask 2.6: Add logging for persona storage operations (success/failure) as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#logging`.

- [ ] **Task 3: Develop Persona Setup UI (AC: 1)**

    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create a new React/Next.js page component for persona setup, ideally `src/app/(persona-setup)/page.tsx` as per `docs/front-end-project-structure.md`.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement a questionnaire form on this page to capture core persona attributes (demographics, preferences, opinions) as envisioned in `docs/front-end-spec.md#user-flow-initial-persona-setup`.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Use standard UI components (`Input`, `Dropdown`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`) conforming to `docs/front-end-component-guide.md#template-for-component-specification` and `docs/front-end-style-guide.md#styling-approach`.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Implement client-side form validation for a good user experience, adhering to rules from Task 1.1.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.5: Implement form submission logic to call the `Persona Service API` (POST endpoint) via `src/services/apiClient.ts` as described in `docs/front-end-api-interaction.md`.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.6: Integrate with Zustand store (`src/features/persona/store.ts`) for managing form state and updating the `currentPersona` on successful save as per `docs/front-end-state-management.md`.

- [ ] **Task 4: Create CLI Trigger for Persona Setup (AC: 5)**

    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Develop a Node.js CLI script (in `scripts/`) that can initiate the persona setup process. This script could either:

        - Launch the web UI directly to the persona setup page (if the web UI is the primary input mechanism).

        - Or, if a pure CLI input is desired for initial setup, it could collect data via prompts and directly call the `Persona Service API`.

- [ ] **Task 5: Ensure Secure Storage and Access (AC: 2, 3)**

    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Verify that MongoDB connection strings and other credentials for the Persona Service are loaded from environment variables (`.env`, AWS Secrets Manager) and not hardcoded, as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#secrets-management` and `docs/environment-vars.md`.

    - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Confirm that the `Response Generator` agent (future story) can securely retrieve persona data from the Persona Service via its API, as outlined in the `Core Workflow / Sequence Diagrams` in `docs/sequence-diagrams.md`.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story establishes the core persona management capabilities, involving both backend service creation and basic frontend interaction.

- **Monorepo Adherence:** Ensure all new services and UI components are created within their designated `src/services/` and `src/web-ui/` directories respectively, following the `docs/project-structure.md`.

- **Data Model:** The `Persona` interface in `docs/data-models.md` is central. Ensure your backend and frontend code strictly adheres to this schema.

- **API Interaction:** For backend (Persona Service), implement the defined API endpoints. For frontend, use the `apiClient.ts` to interact with this new service.

- **Database:** Use MongoDB for persona storage. Implement schema enforcement at the application layer through validation.

- **State Management (Frontend):** Leverage Zustand for the frontend state for persona data, following patterns defined in `docs/front-end-state-management.md`.

- **Security:** Pay close attention to input validation and secure credential handling as per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#security-best-practices`.

- **Coding Standards & Testing:** Follow all `docs/operational-guidelines.md#coding-standards` for TypeScript/Node.js and `docs/operational-guidelines.md#overall-testing-strategy` for unit and integration tests for both the Persona Service and the Persona Setup UI.

    - Unit tests for Persona Service: Validate API routes, data storage, and retrieval logic.

    - Unit tests for Persona Setup UI: Validate component rendering, form state updates, and API call triggering.

    - Test file locations and naming conventions as defined in `docs/operational-guidelines.md#unit-test-file-organization`.

- **Logging:** Implement comprehensive structured logging for all operations within the Persona Service and Frontend, including successful data storage and any errors.
