# Story 3.2: Apply Varied Navigation and Interaction Patterns

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a FormWhisperer agent

- I want to apply varied navigation and interaction patterns

- so that my survey completion appears natural and avoids detection as a bot.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- The agent randomly introduces small delays (e.g., 0.5-2 seconds) between interactions.

- The agent varies its scrolling behavior (e.g., sometimes full scroll, sometimes partial).

- When selecting a survey from a list, the agent occasionally applies random filtering criteria (e.g., "most points," "shortest time") before making a selection.

- The agent sometimes directly navigates to a survey URL and other times goes through the main dashboard.

- The system logs the chosen navigation path and interaction variability details.

- Local command-line test script can demonstrate varied navigation patterns on a test platform.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Implement Variable Interaction Delays (AC: 1)**

    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Within the `browser-automator` agent (`src/agents/browser-automator/`), add a function to introduce a random delay between automation actions (e.g., clicks, types, navigation).

    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Define a configurable range for these delays (e.g., 0.5 to 2 seconds).

    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Integrate this delay function into existing interaction methods (e.g., after a click, after typing a field).

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Varied Scrolling Behavior (AC: 2)**

    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: In `browser-automator`, develop methods for different scrolling patterns (e.g., `scroll_full_page`, `scroll_partial_random`, `scroll_to_element`).

    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Introduce logic to randomly select a scrolling pattern when appropriate (e.g., after page load, before interacting with elements below the fold).

- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Varied Survey Selection Logic (AC: 3, 4)**

    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Update the `automation-orchestrator` service (`src/services/automation-orchestrator/`) to manage survey selection strategies.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Define an enumerable set of selection strategies (e.g., "random", "highest_points", "shortest_time").

    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Implement logic to randomly choose a selection strategy for each new survey session.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Develop `browser-automator` functions (or extend existing ones) to interact with survey filtering UI elements (e.g., sort by, filter by duration) if a filtering strategy is chosen.

    - [ ] Subtask 3.5: Implement logic to randomly choose between direct URL navigation to a survey vs. navigating through the main dashboard and then selecting a survey.

- [ ] **Task 4: Logging Interaction Variability (AC: 5)**

    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Ensure `browser-automator` and `automation-orchestrator` log details about the chosen navigation path, selected filtering criteria, and the specific delays applied, adhering to structured logging standards (`docs/operational-guidelines.md#logging`).

- [ ] **Task 5: Develop Local Test Script for Variability (AC: 6)**

    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Enhance existing local test scripts (from previous stories) or create a new one (in `scripts/`) to demonstrate the varied navigation and interaction patterns.

    - [ ] Subtask 5.2: The script should perform multiple simulated survey selections and form interactions, showing different paths and timing variations.

    - [ ] Subtask 5.3: Verify that the logs reflect the applied variability.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is crucial for meeting the "Realistic Human Behavior Emulation" non-functional requirement defined in the PRD, relying heavily on the `Browser Automator`.

- **Browser Automation Frameworks:** This story will primarily use `Browser Use` and `Browser MCP` within the Python `browser-automator` to implement precise control over timing, scrolling, and navigation. Refer to `docs/tech-stack.md`.

- **Randomization:** Utilize Python's `random` module or similar to introduce variability in delays, scroll amounts, and selection strategies.

- **Orchestration:** The `automation-orchestrator` service will be responsible for deciding *which* variability strategy to apply, while the `browser-automator` implements the *how*. Refer to `docs/component-view.md` for their respective roles and `docs/sequence-diagrams.md` for the workflow.

- **Logging:** Implement robust, structured JSON logging for all introduced variations. This is essential for verifying that the behavior is indeed varied and for debugging. Adhere to `docs/operational-guidelines.md#logging`.

- **Coding Standards & Testing:** Adhere to Python and TypeScript coding standards (including type hints/strict typing), naming conventions, and unit test file organization as defined in `docs/operational-guidelines.md`.

    - Unit tests for `browser-automator`: Focus on the implementation of variable delays, different scrolling patterns, and the ability to apply different selection criteria.

    - Integration tests: Verify the `automation-orchestrator` can command `browser-automator` to exhibit these varied behaviors on a test platform.

    - E2E tests (`docs/operational-guidelines.md#end-to-end-e2e-tests`): Crucial for visually confirming the "human-like" quality of these interactions on actual survey platforms (even dummy ones).
