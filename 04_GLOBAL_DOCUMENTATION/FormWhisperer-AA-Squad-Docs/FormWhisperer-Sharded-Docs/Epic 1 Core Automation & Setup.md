# Epic 1: Core Automation & Setup

- Goal: Establish the foundational capabilities for browser automation, environment setup, and basic persona initialization to enable the first automated survey completion.

- Story 1.1: As a FormWhisperer user, I want to set up the application environment and launch a browser instance so that I can prepare for automated form completion.

    - Acceptance Criteria List:

        - The application can be initialized and configured.

        - A browser instance (Chrome or Chromium) can be launched and controlled.

        - The browser can navigate to a specified URL.

        - The browser can successfully log into a dummy survey platform (for testing).

        - The system logs successful browser launch and navigation.

        - CLI commands are available to initiate browser launch and navigate to a URL.

- Story 1.2: As a FormWhisperer user, I want to provide initial persona details so that the AI agent can begin to answer questions as me.

    - Acceptance Criteria List:

        - A mechanism exists (e.g., initial questionnaire) for the user to input core persona attributes (e.g., basic demographics, general preferences).

        - The persona data is securely stored.

        - The AI agent can access this initial persona data for response generation.

        - The system logs successful persona data storage.

        - A CLI command is available to trigger persona data input process.
