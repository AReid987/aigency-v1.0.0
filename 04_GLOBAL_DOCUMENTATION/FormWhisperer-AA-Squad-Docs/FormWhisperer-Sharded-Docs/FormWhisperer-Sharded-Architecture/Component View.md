# Component View

## Architectural / Design Patterns Adopted

- **Microservices (within Monorepo):** For clear separation of concerns, allowing specialized teams/agents (e.g., browser automation, persona management, HITL) to operate independently.

- **Facade Pattern:** The `Automation Orchestrator` acts as a facade, simplifying the interface to the underlying browser automation, form parsing, and response generation complexities.

- **Observer Pattern (for HITL):** The `HITL Orchestration Service` could use an observer pattern to notify the user (via messaging app) and await a response.

- **Strategy Pattern:** The `Response Generator` might employ different strategies for answering based on question type (e.g., open-ended, multiple choice, demographic) and persona depth.

- **Repository Pattern:** The `Persona Service` will likely abstract data access to the MongoDB.

## Component View

- **Web UI Service:** (React/Next.js) - Responsible for providing a user interface for initial persona setup, potentially monitoring agent status, and displaying HITL prompts (though HITL is primarily external messaging).

- **Persona Service:** (Node.js/Express/MongoDB) - Manages the creation, storage, retrieval, and updating of user persona profiles. It provides an API for other internal services to access persona data.

- **HITL Orchestration Service:** (Node.js/Express, Telegram Bot API) - Handles communication with external messaging platforms (e.g., Telegram) to send HITL requests to the user and receive their responses, relaying them back to the automation orchestrator.

- **Automation Orchestrator:** (Node.js) - The central brain. It receives tasks (e.g., "complete survey"), orchestrates the `Browser Automator`, `Form Parser`, and `Response Generator`, and triggers the `HITL Service` when human intervention is needed.

- **Browser Automator:** (Python, Browser Use/Browser MCP) - The direct interface to the web browser. It executes commands from the `Automation Orchestrator` to navigate, click, type, scroll, and retrieve page content. It's responsible for the "human-like" interaction patterns.

- **Form Parser:** (Python) - Analyzes the HTML DOM received from the `Browser Automator` to identify form fields, their types, and associated labels/questions. It provides a structured representation of the form to the `Response Generator`.

- **Response Generator:** (Python, LLM, LangChain) - Consumes questions from the `Form Parser` (via `Automation Orchestrator`), retrieves persona context from the `Persona Service`, and generates appropriate, persona-consistent answers using a Large Language Model (LLM).

- **Large Language Model (LLM):** (External API) - The underlying AI for natural language understanding and generation, providing the core intelligence for the `Response Generator`.
