# Front-End Testing Strategy

## Frontend Testing Strategy

This section elaborates on the "Testing Strategy" from the main architecture document, focusing on frontend-specific aspects.

- **Link to Main Overall Testing Strategy:** `docs/architecture.md#overall-testing-strategy`

### Component Testing

- **Scope:** Testing individual UI components in isolation (e.g., PersonaInputForm, HitlPromptDisplay).

- **Tools:** React Testing Library with Jest.

- **Focus:** Rendering with various props, user interactions (clicks, input changes), event emission, basic internal state changes. Snapshot testing will be used sparingly.

- **Location:** `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.tsx` co-located alongside components, or in a `__tests__` subdirectory.

### Feature/Flow Testing (UI Integration)

- **Scope:** Testing how multiple components interact to fulfill a small user flow or feature within a page (e.g., persona setup form submission).

- **Tools:** React Testing Library with Jest.

- **Focus:** Data flow between components, conditional rendering based on interactions, integration with mocked services/state.

### End-to-End UI Testing Tools & Scope

- **Tools:** Playwright.

- **Scope (Frontend Focus):**

    - User completing the Persona Setup Questionnaire successfully.

    - Verification of HITL prompt display and user response submission (if web-based HITL is implemented).

    - Key UI interactions within any management dashboard (if implemented).

- **Test Data Management for UI:** API mocking layer (e.g., MSW) or backend seeding scripts will provide consistent test data.
