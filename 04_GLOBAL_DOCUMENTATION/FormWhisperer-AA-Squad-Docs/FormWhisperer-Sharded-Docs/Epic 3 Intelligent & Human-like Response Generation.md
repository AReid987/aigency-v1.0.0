# Epic 3: Intelligent & Human-like Response Generation

- Goal: Implement the core AI logic for generating persona-consistent responses, particularly for qualitative and sensitive questions, and introduce human-like behavioral variability.

- Story 3.1: As a FormWhisperer agent, I want to generate contextually relevant and persona-consistent answers for open-ended survey questions so that I can complete qualitative sections of a survey authentically.

    - Acceptance Criteria List:

        - The agent can parse an open-ended question prompt.

        - The agent generates a textual response (minimum X characters, maximum Y characters, where X, Y are configurable) based on the current persona's profile and the question context.

        - The generated response maintains the persona's established tone and opinion where applicable.

        - The system logs the generated response and the question it answered.

        - Local command-line test script can simulate open-ended questions and verify response generation.

- Story 3.2: As a FormWhisperer agent, I want to apply varied navigation and interaction patterns so that my survey completion appears natural and avoids detection as a bot.

    - Acceptance Criteria List:

        - The agent randomly introduces small delays (e.g., 0.5-2 seconds) between interactions.

        - The agent varies its scrolling behavior (e.g., sometimes full scroll, sometimes partial).

        - When selecting a survey from a list, the agent occasionally applies random filtering criteria (e.g., "most points," "shortest time") before making a selection.

        - The agent sometimes directly navigates to a survey URL and other times goes through the main dashboard.

        - The system logs the chosen navigation path and interaction variability details.

        - Local command-line test script can demonstrate varied navigation patterns on a test platform.
