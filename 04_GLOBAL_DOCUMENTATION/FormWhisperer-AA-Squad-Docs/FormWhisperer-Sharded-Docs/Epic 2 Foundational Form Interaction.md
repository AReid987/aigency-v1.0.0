# Epic 2: Foundational Form Interaction

- Goal: Enable the AI agent to interact with and complete basic, common form field types found in market research surveys.

- Story 2.1: As a FormWhisperer agent, I want to identify and fill out text input fields so that I can provide textual answers to survey questions.

    - Acceptance Criteria List:

        - The agent can detect single-line and multi-line text input fields.

        - The agent can type alphanumeric characters into detected text fields.

        - The agent's typing speed varies realistically (e.g., between 50-70 WPM).

        - The agent can clear existing text from a field before typing.

        - The system logs successful text field completion.

        - Local command-line test script can verify text field completion on a test page.

- Story 2.2: As a FormWhisperer agent, I want to identify and select options from dropdown menus, checkboxes, and radio buttons so that I can answer multiple-choice and selection-based questions.

    - Acceptance Criteria List:

        - The agent can detect dropdown (select) elements and select an option by text or value.

        - The agent can detect and click checkboxes to select/deselect them.

        - The agent can detect and click radio buttons to select an option within a group.

        - The agent randomly varies the click speed for these elements.

        - The system logs successful selection/clicking of these elements.

        - Local command-line test script can verify selection on a test page.
