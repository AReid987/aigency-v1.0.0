Here is the initial draft of the Project Brief for **FormWhisperer**, incorporating all the details we've discussed:

# Project Brief: FormWhisperer

## Introduction / Problem Statement

The core problem FormWhisperer aims to solve is the tedious, time-consuming, and repetitive task of manually filling out varied online forms, starting with market research surveys. Current methods often require significant human effort, leading to inefficiency and potential for human error or fatigue in data collection. FormWhisperer addresses this pain point by automating the completion of these forms with human-like intelligence and interaction, freeing up users' time and enabling scaled data collection and persona-based interactions.

## Vision & Goals

- **Vision:** To become the leading AI-powered solution for autonomously and intelligently completing diverse online forms, mimicking human behavior and personalized responses, thereby transforming data collection, operational efficiency, and user interaction simulation across various digital platforms.

- **Primary Goals (MVP):**

    - Goal 1: Develop an AI agent capable of autonomously navigating and completing market research survey forms in a browser.

    - Goal 2: Enable the AI agent to handle varied input types (open-ended, dropdowns, checkboxes, sliders, dynamic elements).

    - Goal 3: Implement human-like interaction patterns including variable navigation, varied survey selection, and realistic typing/clicking speeds to avoid detection.

    - Goal 4: Allow for initial persona modeling based on user-provided data, enabling the AI to answer demographic and open-ended questions "as if they were me."

    - Goal 5: Establish a human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanism for the AI to seek clarification or assistance when encountering unforeseen scenarios, thereby facilitating continuous learning.

- **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**

    - Percentage of completed surveys without human intervention.

    - Accuracy of AI-generated responses against user's defined persona.

    - Time saved by users compared to manual form completion.

    - Successful bypassing of anti-automation measures on survey platforms.

    - Number of unique form types successfully completed.

## Target Audience / Users

For now, the primary user of FormWhisperer is you. Initially, the app will serve an individual user looking to automate their own market research survey participation and data collection, simulating their unique persona in responses.

## Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)

- **Autonomous Browser Interaction:** Ability for an AI agent to control a browser instance (headless or visible) to navigate URLs, log in, select surveys, scroll, click, and type.

- **Multi-Input Form Completion:** Capability to interact with and accurately fill various form fields including text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more complex dynamic UI elements like sliders or calendars.

- **Persona-Based Responding:** AI agent answers questions, particularly open-ended and demographic ones, consistently reflecting a learned persona.

- **Realistic Human Behavior Emulation:** Integration of varied interaction patterns such as:

    - Randomized navigation paths (e.g., direct to survey vs. filtered search).

    - Diverse survey selection criteria (e.g., by 'most points', 'shortest time', 'random pick').

    - Human-like typing speeds (slightly above average WPM) and varying idle times.

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Integration:** Mechanism (e.g., via Telegram or text messaging) for the AI to query the user for input or clarification when uncertain about a response or interaction.

- **Initial Persona Data Collection:** A method for the user to provide initial data (e.g., via an initial survey) to build the foundational persona model.

## Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas

- **Advanced Persona Modeling:**

    - Integration with external data sources (e.g., Twitter profiles via frameworks like Eliza OS) to enrich and dynamically update AI personas.

    - A dedicated "Persona Builder" UI allowing users to explicitly define, refine, and manage multiple AI personas.

- **Broadened Form Compatibility:** Extension of capabilities to other complex and tedious online forms such as:

    - Job applications.

    - Government forms (e.g., for veterans' benefits, Medicaid applications).

    - Online registrations, feedback forms, and customer support tickets.

- **Learning and Adaptation Engine:** Enhanced AI learning capabilities to continuously improve autonomous completion accuracy and human-like behavior based on HITL interactions and successful completions.

- **Reporting and Analytics:** Dashboards to track completed forms, AI performance, time savings, and generated insights.

- **Multi-User / Team Support:** Functionality to manage multiple AI agents or personas for a team or organization.

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

- **Browser Automation Frameworks:** Strong preference for using performant and robust browser automation frameworks such as 'Browser Use' and 'Browser MCP' for interacting with web UIs.

- **AI Persona Modeling:** Exploration of techniques similar to Eliza OS for persona modeling, potentially leveraging public user data (with user consent and privacy safeguards).

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Communication:** Use of accessible messaging platforms like Telegram or generic text messaging for real-time human intervention and data collection.

- **AI Agent Autonomy:** The core AI agent should be capable of independent decision-making within the browser environment.

## Relevant Research (Optional)

At this point, no formal research documents have been generated. However, the conceptual understanding draws from insights into browser automation frameworks ('Browser Use', 'Browser MCP') and AI persona modeling techniques (Eliza OS).
