# FormWhisperer UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and high-level visual design specifications for the FormWhisperer project's user interface. Its primary focus is on the Persona Setup/Management Interface and the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Notification/Response Interface, as these are the key user-facing components for the MVP.

- **Link to Primary Design Files:** (To be added: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD URL - *This will be created during a separate design phase once this spec is approved.*)

- **Link to Deployed Storybook / Design System:** (To be added: URL, if applicable - *This will be established during development.*)

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

- **Target User Personas:** The primary user is an individual (you) seeking to automate tedious form completion while maintaining personalized responses.

- **Usability Goals:**

    - **Effortlessness:** Minimizing the effort required from the user for setup and HITL interactions.

    - **Trust:** Building user confidence in the AI agent's ability to accurately represent their persona and complete forms effectively.

    - **Clarity:** Ensuring that HITL prompts are clear, concise, and easy to respond to.

    - **Efficiency:** Streamlining the persona setup process.

- **Design Principles:**

    - **Clarity over cleverness:** Interfaces should be straightforward and unambiguous.

    - **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look, feel, and interaction model across all interfaces.

    - **Provide Feedback:** Clearly communicate the AI agent's status, actions, and any need for human intervention.

    - **Personalization:** Reflect the essence of the user's persona in the AI's responses and interactions.

## Information Architecture (IA)

Given the MVP's focus, the IA is lightweight, primarily revolving around Persona Management and HITL.

- **Site Map / Screen Inventory:**

    ```markdown
    graph TD
        A[Start] --> B(Persona Setup);
        B --> C{Agent Running - Idle};
        C -- HITL Needed --> D[HITL Prompt];
        D -- User Response --> C;
        C -- Survey Completed --> E[Completion Notification];
    ```

    - **Persona Setup/Management Interface:** This is where the user initially defines or updates their persona data.

    - **HITL Notification/Response Interface:** The primary interaction point for the user when the AI requires assistance.

- **Navigation Structure:**

    - **Persona Setup:** A guided, sequential flow or a single form.

    - **HITL Interface:** Direct interaction within the chosen messaging platform (Telegram/SMS), not a traditional app navigation. Notifications trigger user attention, and responses are sent directly back.

## User Flows

### User Flow: Initial Persona Setup

- **Goal:** The user provides initial data to build their core AI persona.

- **Steps / Diagram:**

    ```markdown

        actor User
        participant System as FormWhisperer System
        User->>System: Initiate Persona Setup
        System->>User: Present "Initial Questionnaire"
        User->>System: Provide Demographic Data
        System->>User: Present Open-Ended Questions (e.g., opinions)
        User->>System: Provide Qualitative Responses
        System->>System: Securely Store Persona Data
        System->>User: Confirm Persona Saved
    ```

### User Flow: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Intervention

- **Goal:** The user provides guidance to the AI agent to resolve ambiguities during form completion.

- **Steps / Diagram:**

    ```markdown
    sequenceDiagram
        actor User
        participant Agent as FormWhisperer Agent
        participant Platform as Messaging Platform (e.g., Telegram)
        Agent->>Agent: Encounter Ambiguous Question / Low Confidence
        Agent->>Platform: Send HITL Request (Question, Context, Options)
        Platform->>User: Notify User of HITL Request
        User->>Platform: Review Request
        User->>Platform: Send Response (e.g., text, choice)
        Platform->>Agent: Relay User Response
        Agent->>Agent: Process Human Input & Resume Task
        Agent->>Agent: Learn from Interaction (optional)
    ```

## Wireframes & Mockups

(Placeholder for detailed visual designs. These will be linked from Figma/Sketch after this specification is reviewed and approved.)

- **Screen / View Name: Persona Setup Questionnaire (Conceptual Layout)**

    - A clean, single-column form or a multi-step wizard.

    - Clear headings for sections (e.g., "Demographics," "Preferences," "Opinions").

    - Standard input fields (text, radio, dropdowns).

    - Progress indicator if multi-step.

    - Prominent "Save Persona" or "Complete Setup" button.

- **Screen / View Name: HITL Messaging Interface (Conceptual Layout within Messaging App)**

    - Messages from FormWhisperer will be clearly formatted, indicating the question context and options for response.

    - User replies directly within the chat interface.

    - Example: "HITL Required: Question: 'What is your opinion on [topic]?' Current context: [brief summary]. Options: 1. Strongly Agree 2. Agree 3. Disagree 4. Strongly Disagree. Or type a custom response."

## Component Library / Design System Reference

Initially, FormWhisperer will use a minimalist, functional design system. Components will primarily be standard web form elements with clean styling.

- **Foundational Components (Conceptual):**

    - **Input Fields:** Text, Number, Email (standard HTML with clean borders, consistent sizing).

    - **Buttons:** Primary (e.g., "Save," "Submit"), Secondary (e.g., "Cancel," "Skip").

    - **Radio Buttons / Checkboxes:** Standard, accessible styling.

    - **Dropdowns:** Standard, accessible styling.

    - **Toasts/Notifications:** For HITL prompts and completion confirmations within the messaging app.

## Branding & Style Guide Reference

(To be defined, but aiming for functionality and unobtrusiveness in the MVP.)

- **Color Palette:** Neutral base (grays, whites) with a single accent color for primary actions.

- **Typography:** A clean, legible sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or system font stack).

- **Iconography:** Simple, clear icons (e.g., for alerts, confirmations).

- **Spacing & Grid:** Consistent use of a base unit (e.g., 8px) for margins, padding, and component spacing to ensure visual harmony.

## Accessibility (AX) Requirements

- **Target Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 AA (Aspirations for MVP, focusing on core interactive elements).

- **Specific Requirements:**

    - All form fields and interactive elements must be keyboard navigable and operable.

    - Appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `role`) for custom elements or complex interactions (if any emerge).

    - Sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements.

    - Clear focus indicators for all interactive elements.

    - Screen reader compatibility for persona setup forms and HITL messages.

## Responsiveness

- **Breakpoints:**

    - Mobile: `< 768px`

    - Tablet: `768px - 1024px`

    - Desktop: `> 1024px`

- **Adaptation Strategy:**

    - **Persona Setup UI:** Layouts should be fluid and stack vertically on smaller screens. Input fields should scale to fit width.

    - **HITL Interface:** Relies on the responsiveness of the chosen messaging platform. Messages will be text-based, ensuring mobile compatibility.
