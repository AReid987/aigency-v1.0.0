# Story 3.2: Create and Display Data Visualization

# **Story 3.2: Create and Display Data Visualization**

**Status:** Done

**Epic:** Prototyping & Visualization Showcase

---

### **Story**

- **As a** user,

- **I want to** ask the Aigency Squad to create a data visualization from one of my uploaded files,

- **so that** the resulting chart is displayed in the Showcase for analysis.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**

1. Given I have uploaded a data file (e.g., a CSV or a Jupyter Notebook like `ai-job-market.ipynb`), I must be able to ask an agent to analyze it (e.g., "Visualize the data in `ai-job-market.ipynb`").

2. The AI agent must be able to access and parse the content of the specified uploaded file.

3. The agent must generate a data visualization, such as a bar chart, line graph, or pie chart, based on the data in the file.

4. The generated visualization must be displayed cleanly within the "Showcase" area of the project workspace.

5. The visualization should be interactive if possible (e.g., tooltips on hover), or a high-quality static image if interactivity is not feasible for the POC.

6. I must have an option to download the generated chart as an image file (e.g., PNG or SVG).

### **Tasks / Subtasks**

- **Frontend:**

    - [x] Implement a file upload mechanism within the "Collaboratory" interface.

    - [ ] Design a UI component to render the generated charts or graphs in the "Showcase" area.

    - [ ] Add a "Download" button to the visualization component.

- **Backend:**

    - [x] Implement file handling logic to securely store and access user-uploaded files.

    - [ ] Enhance the AI agent's capabilities to include data analysis and visualization skills. This will likely involve integrating libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib or Plotly for chart generation.

    - [ ] Create a service that can execute the data analysis code and save the resulting visualization as an image file.

    - [ ] Create a new API endpoint to serve the generated visualization image to the frontend.

---

### **Dev Technical Guidance**

- For the POC, the data analysis can be handled by a specific "Data Analyst" agent persona that is skilled in Python data science libraries.

- The backend should sanitize all uploaded files to mitigate security risks.

- The visualization generation should be robust enough to handle common data formats and produce clear, legible charts.

- Using a library like Plotly is recommended as it can generate interactive HTML/JavaScript charts, which could be rendered directly in a frontend component without needing to be converted to static images.
