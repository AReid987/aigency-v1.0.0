# Story 2.1: View Project Plan on Kanban Board

# **Story 2.1: View Project Plan on Kanban Board**

**Status:** To Do

**Epic:** Agile Project Management

---

### **Story**

- **As a** user,

- **I want to** view a Kanban board for my project that displays the Epics and User Stories we've defined,

- **so that** I can have a clear, high-level overview of the project plan.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**

1. A "Project Board" or "Kanban" view must be accessible within a project, for example, via a tab or sidebar link.

2. When I navigate to this view, it must display columns representing the status of work (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

3. The Epics defined in the PRD must be displayed as distinct visual sections, such as swimlanes or large header cards.

4. The User Stories associated with each Epic must appear as individual cards within their respective Epic's section.

5. Each story card must clearly display its title (e.g., "Story 1.1: Initiate a New Project via Conversation").

6. The initial status of all stories for the POC should default to the "To Do" column.

---

### **Tasks / Subtasks**

- **Frontend:**

    - [ ] Create a new page component for the Kanban board view (e.g., `apps/web/app/projects/{projectId}/board/page.tsx`).

    - [ ] Design and build reusable components for the Kanban board, columns, and story cards, adhering to the "glassy" and "sentient" UI principles.

    - [ ] Implement the logic to fetch the project's epics and stories from the backend API.

    - [ ] Implement the rendering logic to correctly display the epics and place the story cards in the appropriate columns based on their status.

- **Backend:**

    - [ ] Create a new API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/board`) to retrieve all the data needed for the Kanban view.

    - [ ] The endpoint's response should be structured hierarchically, containing the list of epics, with each epic containing its list of associated stories.

    - [ ] Ensure the data for each story includes its ID, title, epic, and status.

---

### **Dev Technical Guidance**

- The frontend should utilize a library like `dnd-kit` or a similar modern drag-and-drop library to prepare for the functionality in Story 2.2, even if the drag-and-drop feature itself is not implemented in this story.

- The API response should be optimized to send all necessary data in a single request to prevent multiple network calls when loading the board.

- The UI components for the board should be built with performance in mind, especially if a project were to have a large number of stories in the future.
