# Story 1.3: Generate Initial Boilerplate Code

# **Story 1.3: Generate Initial Boilerplate Code**

**Status:** To Do

**Epic:** The Aigency Collaboratory & Development Core

---

### **Story**

- **As a** solo developer,

- **I want** the Aigency Squad to generate the initial boilerplate code for the main application entry points after the project scaffolding is created,

- **so that** the application is runnable and I can see a "hello world" equivalent.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria (ACs)**

1. Given I have approved the project structure (from Story 1.2), an AI agent must inform me that it will now generate the initial application code.

2. The system must generate the code for the frontend entry point (e.g., `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` and `apps/web/app/page.tsx` for Next.js) and display it to me.

3. The generated frontend code must render a functional, minimal placeholder page (e.g., it should display the project name and a "Welcome to Aigency!" message).

4. The system must generate the code for the backend entry point (e.g., `apps/api/main.py` for FastAPI), including a basic root endpoint that returns a simple JSON message (e.g., `{"message": "Hello from Aigency API"}`).

5. After the code is generated, the system must provide me with the necessary commands (e.g., `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev`) to run the application locally.

6. When I run the application locally, both the frontend and backend must start without errors, and I can view the placeholder page in my browser.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**

- **Frontend:**

    - [ ] Create a generic code display component with syntax highlighting to show the generated code in the chat interface.

    - [ ] Generate the content for `layout.tsx`, including basic HTML structure and body tags.

    - [ ] Generate the content for `page.tsx`, including a main heading and a simple paragraph.

- **Backend:**

    - [ ] Create a "Code Generation" service that takes a file path and content as input and writes the file to the project's directory.

    - [ ] This service should be triggered after the successful completion of Story 1.2.

    - [ ] The service must generate the content for `main.py` with a simple FastAPI root endpoint.

    - [ ] The service must return the generated code content to the frontend for display.

---

### **Dev Technical Guidance**

- The generated code must be clean, well-formatted, and adhere to the coding standards defined in the architecture.

- The frontend placeholder should be styled minimally using Tailwind CSS, confirming that the CSS pipeline is working correctly.

- The process should continue to be conversational. The AI agent should clearly state what it's doing, show the code it has generated, and then provide clear instructions on how to run it.
