## SUMMARY

GeeksforGeeks article titled "Minimax Algorithm in Game Theory | Set 1 (Introduction)" provides an introduction to the Minimax algorithm used in game theory. The article explains how the algorithm works in decision-making and turn-based games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Chess. It was created by GeeksforGeeks and published on June 14, 2016.

## IDEAS:

- The Minimax algorithm is a kind of backtracking algorithm used in game theory to find the optimal move for a player.
- It is widely used in two-player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, and Chess.
- The algorithm involves two players: the maximizer and the minimizer.
- The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible, while the minimizer tries to get the lowest score possible.
- Every board state has a value associated with it, calculated by some heuristics unique to each game.
- The algorithm tries all possible moves and backtracks to make a decision.
- The example provided demonstrates how the algorithm chooses the optimal move considering the opponent also plays optimally.
- The implementation of the Minimax algorithm is provided in C++, Java, C#, Python3, and JavaScript.
- The time complexity of the Minimax algorithm is O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the game tree.
- The space complexity is O(bd), where b is the branching factor and d is the maximum depth of the tree.
- The article mentions that the Minimax algorithm can be extended to games with more choices and where the scores are derived rather than given.
- The article concludes by mentioning that the next article will cover the Tic Tac Toe game using the Minimax algorithm.

## QUOTES:

- "Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally."
- "In Minimax the two players are called maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible."
- "Every board state has a value associated with it. In a given state if the maximizer has upper hand then, the score of the board will tend to be some positive value. If the minimizer has the upper hand in that board state then it will tend to be some negative value."
- "Since this is a backtracking based algorithm, it tries all possible moves, then backtracks and makes a decision."
- "The optimal value is: 12"
- "The idea of this article is to introduce Minimax with a simple example."
- "In the above example, there are only two choices for a player. In general, there can be more choices."
- "We will soon be covering Tic Tac Toe with Minimax algorithm."

## FACTS:

- The Minimax algorithm is used in game theory for decision-making in turn-based games.
- The algorithm involves two players: the maximizer and the minimizer.
- The algorithm calculates the optimal move by considering all possible moves and backtracking.
- The time complexity of the Minimax algorithm is O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the game tree.
- The space complexity is O(bd), where b is the branching factor and d is the maximum depth of the tree.
