# Aigency POC Project Brief

### **1. Project Brief (From Clara, Analyst)**

- **Problem:** Individual creators and small teams are rich with ideas but constrained by resources, slowing down their ability to build and launch.

- **Vision:** To be the platform that powers the world's first one-person, billion-dollar enterprise by acting as an AI-powered force multiplier.

- **Target Audience:** Solo developers, entrepreneurs, educators, artists, and knowledge workers in teams of 1-5.

### **2. Product Requirements Document (PRD) (From Michael, PM)**

- **Goal:** To validate that an AI squad can take an idea from conception to a high-quality, deployable SPA through a conversational interface.

- **Functional Requirements:**

    1. **Collaborative Ideation:** A space to brainstorm and track ideas.

    2. **AI-Powered Development:** The core conversational interface with the Aigency Squad.

    3. **Project Management:** An intuitive Kanban board to visualize workflow.

    4. **Prototyping & Visualization:** A showcase to display generated apps and reports.

- **Key Epics:**

    - **Epic 1:** The Aigency Collaboratory & Development Core

    - **Epic 2:** Agile Project Management

    - **Epic 3:** Prototyping & Visualization Showcase

### **3. System Architecture (From Ava, Architect)**

- **Architecture:** A **Turborepo monorepo** containing a Next.js frontend and a Python/FastAPI backend.

- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** for the POC, with the option to add MongoDB later.

- **Data Models:** Core models for `User`, `Project`, and `KanbanStory` have been defined.

- **Project Structure:** An `apps/` directory containing `web` and `api`, and a `packages/` directory for shared code.

### **4. Frontend Architecture (From Phoenix, Design Architect)**

- **Guiding Vision:** A "living, sentient UI" that is modern, sleek, glassy, and liquid.

- **Component Strategy:** **Atomic Design** (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms) using Radix UI for accessible primitives.

- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** with a custom theme for glassmorphism effects and fluid animations.

- **Animation:** **Framer Motion** for all UI animations to create a "liquid" feel.

- **State Management:** **Zustand** for managing complex, global UI state.

# Project Brief: Aigency POC

## 1. Introduction / Problem Statement

Individual creators and small teams (1-5 people) are rich with ideas but constrained by limited resources and manpower. The process of turning a concept into a tangible product, service, or piece of content is often slow and fraught with friction. This throttles innovation for a passionate and capable segment of creatorsâ€”including solo developers, teachers with side-hustles, artists, and knowledge workers. Aigency addresses this by providing a platform that acts as a "super-human" force multiplier, giving these small teams the leverage and velocity of a highly effective, AI-powered squad.

## 2. Target Audience / Users

The primary users are ambitious, self-starting creators and small, agile teams who want to build and launch new things efficiently. They are resourceful and creative but need to overcome the inherent limitations of their small size. This includes:

- Product Developers
- Entrepreneurs & Startup Founders
- Educators building tools on the side
- Artists and Content Creators
- Knowledge Workers creating new services or products

## 3. Vision & Goals

**Vision:** To be the platform that powers the world's first one-person, billion-dollar enterprise, enabling a new generation of individual creators and small teams to achieve 10x productivity and impact.

**Goals:**

    - **Function as an "Idea Perpetuator":**
      - The platform must provide a collaborative space for users to brainstorm, develop, and track ideas from conception through to execution.
    - **Establish the "Collaboratory":**
      - The POC must function as a versatile collaboration space supporting real-time and asynchronous work for both remote and in-person teams.
    - **Produce High-Quality Outputs:**
      - The Aigency Squad must be capable of generating elegant, performant, and professional-grade outputs, including content, single-page applications (SPAs), and other multi-agent systems (MASs).

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1. Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)

- A simple, intuitive Kanban board for project management (Epics -> Stories -> Tasks).
- A feature for displaying data visualizations, reports, and prototypes.
- The core "Aigency Agile Squad" conversational interface that allows users to develop products.

### 4.2. Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas

- An infinite canvas with linked nodes (for documents and chat turns).
- A Notion-like editor.
- A tldraw-like whiteboard.
- Real-time embodied agents (e.g., via Agora).

### 4.3. Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

- Core Constraints: The project has no budget, mandating a focus on open-source technologies and services with generous free tiers. Development is on a short timeline, requiring rapid prototyping and efficient tools.
- Architectural Precedent: The existing "Collaboratory" prototype provides a strong starting point, utilizing a monorepo structure (Turborepo) with a Next.js frontend and a Python (FastAPI) backend.
- Technology Preferences (Frontend): Next.js, Drizzle, Tailwind CSS, Radix, Framer Motion, and various 3D libraries (anime.js, Three.js, R3F, Drei).
- Technology Preferences (Backend): A choice between Python (FastAPI) and Node.js (NestJS).
- Technology Preferences (Database): A choice between PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- Technology Preferences (AI/Agents): LangGraph, Langflow, AutoGPT.
- Tooling: A preference for a modern development stack including pnpm, Turborepo, pdm, uv, and Docker.
- Deployment: A flexible approach with options including AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Fly.io, Heroku, and Railway.

### 4.4. Relevant Research (Optional)

Initial research and prototypes have been provided, including the "Collaboratory" and "data-viz-voyage" projects, along with extensive market research documents related to a "Quality Neighbor" concept. These will be valuable assets for the Product Manager and Architects.
