## Description
Redesign the landing page for Aigency to have a visually appealing design and relevant content. The current landing page has no styling and contained an irrelevant heading "Smart Finance Solutions for Growth and Efficiency". Note: Previous implementation only styled the HeroSection - the rest of the page remains unstyled.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Style the entire landing page (all sections) with a modern, visually appealing design
- [x] Update the heading to be relevant to Aigency
- [x] Preserve existing content that is on point
- [x] Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
- [x] Use appropriate color scheme and typography
- [x] Add relevant imagery/graphics related to AI agency

## Implementation Notes
1. The landing page file is located at `apps/web/app/page.tsx`
2. The design should align with Aigency's branding
3. Consider using Tailwind CSS for styling (check project configuration)
4. Add any necessary images to `apps/web/public/` directory
5. Use `pnpm run dev` to test changes (not `npm`)
